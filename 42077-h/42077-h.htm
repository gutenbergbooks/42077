<h1 title="">The Boy Scouts at the
<br />Panama Canal</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">BOY SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>Farmer Hiram Applegate had just finished
breakfast. For this reason, perhaps, he felt
exceptionally good-humored. Even the news he
had read in his morning paper (of the day
before) to the effect that his pet abomination and
aversion, The Boy Scouts, had held a successful
and popular review in New York and received
personal commendation from the President failed
to shake his equanimity.</p>
<p>Outside the farmhouse the spring sun shone
bright and warm. The air was crisp, and odorous
with the scent of apple blossoms. Robins twittered
cheerily, hens clucked and now and then a
blue bird flashed among the orchard trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>As Hiram stepped out on his &ldquo;vendetta,&rdquo; as he
called his verandah&mdash;or, to use the old-fashioned
word and the better one, &ldquo;porch&rdquo;&mdash;he was joined
by a rather heavy-set youth with small, shifty
eyes and a sallow skin which gave the impression
of languishing for soap and water. A suit of
loud pattern, new yellow boots with &ldquo;nobby&rdquo; toes,
and a gaudy necktie did not add to young Jared
Applegate&rsquo;s general appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; he began, after a glance at the old
man&rsquo;s crabbed and wrinkled features, just then
aglow with self-satisfaction, &ldquo;Pop, how about
that money I spoke about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Applegate stared at his offspring from
under his heavy, iron-gray brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine time to be askin&rsquo; fer money!&rdquo; he
snorted indignantly, &ldquo;you just back frum
Panamy&mdash;under a cloud, too, and yet you start
a pesterin&rsquo; me fer money as ef it grew on
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye want it fer, hey?&rdquo; he went on
after a pause. &ldquo;More Bye Scut nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared shook his head as if denying some discreditable
imputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nothing to do with the Boy Scouts
since the day I was kicked out of&mdash;that is, since
I left the Black Wolf troop in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dum glad of it, though you never tole me
what you quit for,&rdquo; muttered the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to get back to that money,&rdquo; said Jared;
&ldquo;as I told you when I got back from the Isthmus,
I need it. Need it bad, too, or I wouldn&rsquo;t ask
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes no diff&rsquo;rence. What d&rsquo;ye want it fer,&mdash;hey?&rdquo;
he repeated, coming back to his original
question.</p>
<p>Jared decided that there was nothing for it but
to tell the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go over what I told you the other night
once more, I&rsquo;m in debt. Debts I ran up on the
Isthmus,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;A chap can&rsquo;t live
down there for nothing you know, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By heck! You got a dern good salary as Mr.
Mainwaring&rsquo;s sec&rsquo;ty, didn&rsquo;t yer, an&rsquo; a chance ter
learn engin-e-ring thrun in. You git fired fer
misbehavin&rsquo; yerself an&rsquo; then yer come down on
the old man fer money. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter stand it,
I ain&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man knocked the ashes out of his half-smoked
pipe with unnecessary violence. Jared,
eying him askance, saw that his father was working
himself up into what Jared termed &ldquo;a tantrum.&rdquo;
Taking another tack, he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho, pop! It ain&rsquo;t as if you weren&rsquo;t going to
get it back. And there&rsquo;ll be interest at six per
cent., too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was touching old Applegate on a tender
point. If rumor in and about Hampton spoke
correctly, the old man had made most of his large
fortune, not so much by farming, but by running,
at ruinous rates, a sort of private bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; he said, his hard, rugged old face
softening the least bit, &ldquo;uv course you&rsquo;ve tole me
all that; but what you h&rsquo;aint tole me is, how yer
a goin&rsquo; ter git ther money back,&mdash;an&rsquo; the
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>He looked cunningly at his son as he spoke.
Jared hesitated an instant before he replied.
Then he said boldly enough:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you just what the business enterprise
is that I expect to go into shortly. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
under a sort of promise not to, you see. But
if everything goes right, I&rsquo;ll be worth a good
round sum before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promises ain&rsquo;t security,&rdquo; retorted the old man
warily. &ldquo;I&mdash;Gee Whitakers! Thar&rsquo;s that spotted
hawg out agin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the dusty road the animal in question
was passing as the farmer&rsquo;s eyes fell on it. In
the center of the track it paused and began rooting
about, grunting contentedly at its liberty.</p>
<p>At the same moment a humming sound, almost
like the drone of a big bumble bee, came out of
the distance. As he heard the peculiar drone, a
quick glance of recognition flashed across old
Applegate&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that pesky Mainwaring gal an&rsquo; her &rsquo;lectric
auto!&rdquo; he exploded vehemently. &ldquo;That makes the
third time in ther last two weeks that Jake&rsquo;s bin
out when she come along. Ther fust time she
knocked him over, ther second time she knocked
him over, an&rsquo; now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smart-looking little electric runabout, driven
by a pretty young girl in motoring costume,
whizzed round the corner. The ill-fated Jake
looked up from his rooting as the car came dashing
on. Possibly the recollection of those other
two narrow escapes was upon him. At any rate,
with a scared grunt and an angry squeal, he
whisked his stump of a curly tail in the air and
dashed for the picket fence in front of the Applegate
place.</p>
<p>But either Jake was too slow, or the electric
was too fast. Just as the girl gave the steering
wheel of the auto a quick twist to avoid the pig,
one of the forewheels struck the luckless Jake
&ldquo;astern,&rdquo; as sailors would say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>With an agonized wail Jake sailed through the
air a few feet and then, alighting on his feet,
galloped off unhurt but squealing as if he had
been mortally injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl alarmedly, and
then, &ldquo;gracious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quick twist of the wheel had caused the
car to give a jump and a skid and land in the
ditch, where it came to a standstill. Farmer
Applegate, rage tinting his face the color of a
boiled beet, came storming down the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the time I got yer, hey?&rdquo; he shouted
at the alarmed occupant of the auto. &ldquo;That
makes three times you run over Jake. You got
away them other times, but I got yer nailed now.
Kaint git yer car out uv ther ditch, hey? Wa&rsquo;al,
it&rsquo;ll stay thar till yer pay up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry,&rdquo; stammered the
girl, &ldquo;really I had no intention of hurting&mdash;er&mdash;Jake.
In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be hurt at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>There appeared to be good reason for such a
supposition. Jake, at the moment, was engaged
in combat over a pile of corn fodder with several
of his fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Prob&rsquo;ly hurt internal,&rdquo; grunted the
farmer. &ldquo;Anyhow, it&rsquo;s time you bubblists was
taught a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course I&rsquo;m willing to pay,&rdquo; cried the
girl, and out came a dainty hand-bag. &ldquo;Er&mdash;how
much will satisfy Jake&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean your&mdash;feelings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old farmer was quick to catch the note of
amusement in the girl&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mend matters by bein&rsquo; sassy,&rdquo; he
growled; &ldquo;besides, your pop fired my boy down
on the Isthmus an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; none too good
toward yer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with my father&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo;
said the girl coldly, noting out of the corner of
her eye Jared&rsquo;s figure slinking around the side of
the porch; &ldquo;how much do you want to help me
get my car out of the ditch, for that&rsquo;s really what
it amounts to, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Ignoring the quiet sarcasm in her voice, old
Applegate&rsquo;s face took on its crafty expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, it&rsquo;s three times now you&rsquo;ve run over
Jake. Say five dollars each time,&mdash;that ud be yer
fine for overspeedin&rsquo;, anyhow,&mdash;that makes it
fifteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen dollars!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice showed her
amazement at such a figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ort&rsquo;er be twenty,&rdquo; snorted old Applegate;
&ldquo;thar&rsquo;s ther injury to Jake&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s. You bang
over him at sixty mile an hour an&rsquo; scare him
out&rsquo;n all his fat an&rsquo; six months&rsquo; growth. Fifteen
dollars is cheap, an&rsquo;&mdash;you don&rsquo;t go till yer pay up,
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s simply extortion. I&rsquo;ll pay no such
sum. Send your bill to my father. He&rsquo;ll settle
it. And now help me out of this ditch, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you git het up, miss. Thar&rsquo;s a
speed law on Long Island, an&rsquo; by heck, you pay
er I&rsquo;ll hev yer up afore the justice. Lucindy!&rdquo; he
raised his voice in a call for his wife; Jared had
vanished. A slovenly-looking woman, wiping her
hands on a gingham apron, appeared on the
porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucindy, how many miles an hour? Jake&rsquo;s
bin run over agin,&rdquo; he added suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; said Lucindy judicially, &ldquo;it looked
like sixty; but I reckin h&rsquo;it warn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; snorted Applegate triumphantly,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; ther speed limit&rsquo;s fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wasn&rsquo;t going more than ten miles!&rdquo;
cried the girl, flushing with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Tell that to ther justice. I&rsquo;ll git my
son to push yer machine out&rsquo;n ther ditch an&rsquo; then
I&rsquo;ll hop in aside yer an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll drive into town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing! Why, the idea!
Take your hand off my car at once, or&mdash;oh, dear!
What shall I do?&rdquo; she broke off despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive me inter town or pay fifteen dollars,
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; declared Farmer
Applegate stubbornly; &ldquo;now then&mdash;hullo, what
in ther name uv early pertaties is this a-comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Around the same corner from which the auto
had appeared with such embarrassing results to
its pretty young driver came three well-built
lads. One of them was rather fat and his round,
good-natured face was streaming with perspiration
from the long &ldquo;hike&rdquo; on which they had
been. But his companions looked trained to the
minute, brown-faced, lithe-limbed, radiating
health and strength from their khaki-clad forms.
All three wore the same kind of uniform, gaiters,
knickerbockers, coats of military cut and broad-brimmed
campaign hats. In addition, each carried
a staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s all this, Rob?&rdquo; cried one of
them as they came into full view of the strange
scene,&mdash;the ditched auto, the flushed, embarrassed
yet indignant girl, and the truculent farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn it all, it&rsquo;s them pesky Boy Scouts
from Hampton,&rdquo; exclaimed Farmer Applegate
disgustedly, as, in answer to the girl&rsquo;s appealing
look, the three youths stepped up, their hands
lifted in the scout salute and their hats raised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">AN ANGRY FARMER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Can we be of any assistance?&rdquo; asked Rob
Blake of the girl, whose alarmed looks made it
evident that she was in an unpleasant situation.
He ignored the red-faced, angry farmer, but took
note out of the corner of his eye of Jared, who
was peeping out at them from behind a shed.
Apparently he had no wish to appear on the scene
while his late employer&rsquo;s daughter was there.
To himself he muttered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that stuck-up Rob Blake, that butter-firkin,
Tubby Hopkins and that sissy, Merritt
Crawford. They&rsquo;re always butting in when
they&rsquo;re not wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned gratefully to the newcomers.
Rob&rsquo;s firm voice and capable appearance made
her feel, as did no less her scrutiny of his companions,
that here were friends in need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I am
Lucy Mainwaring, and you, I&rsquo;m sure, are Rob
Blake, leader of the Eagle Patrol. I&rsquo;ve heard
lots about you from my brother Fred, who is
leader of the Black Wolf Patrol, First New York
Troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Rob Blake, this is Merritt Crawford,
my second in command, and this is Tub&mdash;I mean
Robert Hopkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all on yer,&rdquo; growled out old Applegate,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I tell yer to keep out of this. Just
&rsquo;cause yer a banker&rsquo;s son, young Blake, don&rsquo;t give
you no right ter come interferin&rsquo; where yer not
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they <i>are</i> wanted!&rdquo; cried the girl,
before Rob could say a word. &ldquo;This man says
that I ran over one of his pigs. Why, it&rsquo;s absurd.
I only just bumped the animal, and there he is
over there now fighting for his breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fairly bubbled merriment as Jake&rsquo;s
raucous squeals rose belligerently from the neighborhood
of the hog pens. Tubby spoke up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he can eat, he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; announced the
stout youth with his customary solemnity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve grazed the wretched pig twice
before,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;and Mr. Applegate wants
fifteen dollars or he won&rsquo;t help me out of this
ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; confirmed the farmer, &ldquo;fifteen
dollars er she goes afore the justice fer&mdash;fer
running over Jake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t run over him,&rdquo; retorted Rob,
&ldquo;and anyhow, fifteen dollars is an outrageous
price to ask for your real or fancied injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hog&rsquo;s injuries,&rdquo; corrected the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing almost,&rdquo; whispered Merritt to
Tubby with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s help this
young lady out of the ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned on the power and the three Boy
Scouts shoved with all their might at the rear of
the machine. It quivered, started, stopped, and
then fairly dashed up on to the road. So quickly
had it all been done that before the farmer could
make a move the runabout was on the thoroughfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucindy! Lucindy, let Towser loose!&rdquo; yelled
the old man as soon as he had recovered his
senses.</p>
<p>The woman ran off the porch and in a few
seconds a big, savage-looking bull dog came
bounding out, showing his red fangs and white
teeth.</p>
<p>The girl gave a little scream as the dog looked
up at his master, apparently waiting an order to
rush at the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Rob said to the girl in a quick, low
whisper, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I can&rsquo;t! You&rsquo;ve helped me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was our duty as Scouts. Now turn on
your power and get away. We&rsquo;ll find a way to
deal with the old man, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that it was useless to remain, the girl
applied the power once more and the machine
shot out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn you pesky brats,&rdquo; roared old Applegate,
fairly beside himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sic &rsquo;em, Towse!&rdquo; he shouted the next instant.</p>
<p>Rob had been prepared for some such move as
this. As the dog, with a savage growl, sprang
forward, he brought his staff into play. There
was a flash of the implement, a quick twist, and
the astonished Towser found himself spinning
backward in the direction from which he had
advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t set that dog on us again,&rdquo; cried Rob,
in a clear, commanding voice, &ldquo;if you do, he&rsquo;ll get
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn you!&rdquo; bellowed the farmer again,
&ldquo;air you aidin&rsquo; and abettin&rsquo; lawless acts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as that goes, your hog had no business
in the middle of the road,&rdquo; was the quiet rejoinder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to law about this,&rdquo; shouted the farmer
furiously, brandishing his knotted fist. But he
made no attempt to &ldquo;sic&rdquo; Towser on the boys
again. As for that redoubtable animal, he stood
by his master, his tail between his legs. To use
the vernacular, he appeared to be wondering
&ldquo;what had struck him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As there was nothing to be gained by remaining,
the three Boy Scouts started off anew on
the last stage of their &ldquo;hike,&rdquo; which had been one
of twenty-four miles started the day before to
visit a patrol in a distant town on the island.
They struck off briskly, as boys will when home
is almost in sight and appetites are keen. The
farmer, seeing that nothing was to be gained by
abusing them any further, contented himself by
calling them &ldquo;young varmints&rdquo; and turned back
toward his house.</p>
<p>The boys had not proceeded many paces when
they heard behind them the quick &ldquo;chug-chug&rdquo; of
a motor cycle. Turning, they saw coming
toward them a youth of about Rob&rsquo;s age,
mounted on a red motor cycle which, from the
noise it made, appeared to be of high power. As
he drew alongside them they noticed that he, too,
was in Scout uniform, and that from the handle
bars on his machine fluttered a flag with a black
wolf&rsquo;s head on it. The newcomer stopped his
machine, nimbly alighted and gave the Scout
salute, which the boys returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Fred Mainwaring of the Black
Wolf Patrol of the First New York Troop,&rdquo; he
announced, &ldquo;have you seen anything of a young
lady driving an electric runabout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys exchanged amused glances. Then
Rob recounted the scene in front of the farmhouse.
He also introduced himself and his patrol
mates. Fred Mainwaring, a fine-looking, curly-haired
lad, appeared much diverted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like sis,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
always getting in trouble with that auto of hers;
doing things she aut-n&rsquo;t to, so to speak. Excuse
the pun. It&rsquo;s a bad habit of mine. She went for a
spin this morning and wouldn&rsquo;t wait for me, so
now behold me in chase of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>After some more chat, during which Fred
Mainwaring received a hearty invitation to visit
the quarters of the Eagle Patrol in Hampton, the
boys parted, very well pleased with each other.
The young scouts of the Eagle Patrol already
knew much about the Mainwaring family, Mr.
Mainwaring having recently purchased an estate
just out of Hampton. The newcomer to the community
was preceded by an almost world-wide
reputation as a skillful engineer. Many of the
great problems in connection with Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Big Ditch&rdquo; had been successfully solved by him,
and, although just now he was at home on a &ldquo;furlough,&rdquo;
he was shortly to leave once more for the
Zone.</p>
<p>During the course of their brief chat Fred had
informed the boys that he and his sister were to
accompany their father on the return voyage,
Fred taking the position of secretary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had another chap before he came up from
the tropics,&rdquo; he informed the boys. &ldquo;I guess he
lives somewhere round here. Jared Applegate his
name was. Had to fire him, though, for some
sort of crooked work. I don&rsquo;t know just what it
was; but it must have been something pretty bad,
for dad got mighty angry when he told about it.
You see, in a way I feel responsible. Jared, who
was working as a stenographer and typewriter in
New York, belonged to my troop. I liked him
after a fashion, and got dad to make him his
secretary. It wasn&rsquo;t till after he&rsquo;d left for
Panama that I accidentally found out that Jared,
who had been treasurer of the troop, had been
stealing small sums from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notify dad for fear of worrying him;
but of course Jared was dropped from the troop.
When dad got back from the Isthmus this time I
asked about Jared and found out that he had been
discharged. Just what for, I don&rsquo;t know. Dad
wouldn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know something of Jared&rsquo;s reputation
about here,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none too good.
By the way, that&rsquo;s his father&rsquo;s place back there
where your sister had all the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that his home was somewhere near
Hampton,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>This conversation took place on the roadside
not more than a few feet from a stone wall which
bounded the outlying fields of the Applegate
property. Behind this wall, if the four lads had
known it, was concealed a listener to whom all
their conversation was perfectly plain. Jared
had watched the boys meeting from the dooryard
and had crept cautiously along behind the stone
wall till he arrived at a spot opposite that at which
the group was chatting. &ldquo;Listeners never hear
good of themselves,&rdquo; says the old saw. Jared
assuredly proved its truth that fine spring morning.</p>
<p>An evil look passed over his countenance as he
crouched behind the wall. His sallow face grew
a pasty yellow, with anger. His shifty eyes glittered
furiously as he heard his record discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rdquo; he muttered to
himself, as the boys parted company, Fred Mainwaring
shooting off like a red streak on his
machine. &ldquo;Well, I guess that before long I&rsquo;ll have
my innings, and when I do I&rsquo;ll make it hot for all
of you, especially old man Mainwaring. I&rsquo;ll get
even with him if it takes me a year; but I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;ll be that long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>He drew a letter from his pocket and glanced
over it in the manner of one already familiar with
a missive&rsquo;s contents, but who wishes, by a fresh
perusal, to satisfy himself once more. This is
what he read from the much-creased document:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have what you claim we will talk business
with you. It will be made worth your while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter bore no signature nor address. It
referred to a subject with which the writer, for
an excellent reason, would not have cared to have
his name linked. The &ldquo;big ditch&rdquo; project, the
greatest of the age, perhaps of all time, had,
inconceivable as it may seem, bitter and unscrupulous
enemies. The person who had written that
note to poor, sneaking Jared Applegate was one
of these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">ON A MISSION.</span></h2>
<p>While the three Boy Scouts are trudging back
toward Hampton, we will take the opportunity to
introduce them more fully to our readers who
may not have met them before. Rob Blake, the
son of the local banker in the seashore village of
Hampton, Long Island, had, some time before
the present story opens, founded the Eagle Patrol.
The early days of its existence formed the basis
of the first book of the series, for the lads flocked
eagerly to its standard, and the Patrol was soon
in a flourishing condition, with a well-equipped
room above the local bank building, a fine, up-to-date
structure. The adventures of the Patrol in
camp and Scout life in general were various and
exciting. The boys made some enemies, as was
natural, for many boys wished to belong to their
Patrol who could not be admitted; but in the end,
thanks mainly to their Scout training, all things
came out well for the Eagles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>In the second volume we found &ldquo;The Boy
Scouts on the Range.&rdquo; In this book full details
of Scout principles as put into practice in a wild
and lawless country were related. The pursuit of
Silver Tip, the giant grizzly, popularly supposed
to bear a charmed life, was an interesting feature
of their experience in the West. Indians and
cattle rustlers made trouble for the boys and their
friends, but, although the boys were several times
placed in jeopardy and danger, they emerged with
credit from all their dilemmas.</p>
<p>Still following the lads&rsquo; fortunes, we found
them in the third volume of the series, &ldquo;The Boy
Scouts and the Army Airship,&rdquo; deeply interested
in the subject of aerial navigation. They managed
to give material aid in certain experiments
that the government carried on at a lonely house
on the sea coast near Hampton, and became involved
in some thrilling incidents which still
further put to the test their ability and cleverness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>In &ldquo;The Boy Scouts&rsquo; Mountain Camp,&rdquo; the
scene shifted to the Adirondacks, whither the
boys went, primarily on a quiet camping trip.
But they became involved in an exciting search
for a long missing treasure, immured in an
ancient and almost inaccessible cave in the heart
of a wild region. How they won out against
apparently insurmountable obstacles makes exciting
and instructive reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boy Scouts for Uncle Sam,&rdquo; the fifth
volume, related some surprising events that
occurred when the boys&rsquo; aid was called into requisition
in connection with a new type of submarine
which foreign powers were doing their best to
appropriate, but which was intended for the
United States Government. Readers of that
volume will readily recall Rob&rsquo;s abduction and
marooning on a desert island and the pernicious
activities of a green motor boat which was used
by the agents of a foreign power. Rob&rsquo;s marvelous
swim across a narrow inlet, through which
the tide boiled like a mill race, and the interchange
of Scout signals with astonishing results,
are only two of the incidents that go to show that
the Eagle Patrol was always to be relied upon
to do its duty and live up to the strict letter of
the inspiring motto, &ldquo;Be Prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p class="tb">For the next few days the lads of the Eagle
Patrol were busy indeed with preparations for
what was to them a very important piece of work.
This was nothing more nor less than the placarding
of the town with announcements that a team
made up of the Eagles would play the Hampton
nine in the first baseball game of the season, the
proceeds to be equally divided. The Boy Scouts&rsquo;
half, of course, would go toward the general
patrol fund for the purchase of equipment and
so on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Each of the lads had a duty to perform in this
connection. Hiram Nelson, whose father was in
the printing business, was to get up the posters,
which were to be printed on big, yellow sheets.
Andy Bowles, whose uncle conducted a livery
stable, arranged for rigs to convey the young
bill-posters around the country; while Tubby
Hopkins,&mdash;since the duty was partly of a culinary
nature,&mdash;undertook to make the paste. This,
despite unkind remarks to the effect that, unable
to restrain his appetite, he might be tempted to
eat it! In this manner the different duties were
distributed and each member of the patrol took
an active part in the work.</p>
<p>Rather to Rob&rsquo;s surprise, and likewise to the
astonishment of the other lads, Jared Applegate&rsquo;s
name appeared as pitcher for the Hampton team.
But, after all, there was nothing so very astonishing
in this, for Jared, before he left for New
York, had been a clever pitcher on the Hampton
Academy team, which had beaten some of the
best ball players on Long Island. Sam Lamb, the
regular pitcher for the Hamptons, it was later
learned, had sprained his wrist in jumping on a
moving train, and Jared had eagerly volunteered
to take his place. He had made open boasts about
the town that he meant to &ldquo;knock some of those
tin soldier kids higher than so many kites.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do his best,&rdquo; was all Rob had said,
when Andy Bowles, the diminutive bugler of the
Eagles, brought him this information.</p>
<p>When not engaged in preparations for &ldquo;billing&rdquo;
the surrounding country, which occupied
almost all the time they could spare from their
studies, the Scouts practiced hard and faithfully.
They had a good team, but they had to admit
that the town boys, too, played very good ball.
As the day for the contest, a Saturday, drew
near, excitement began to run high. Jared never
spoke to any of the Scouts, all of whom, by this
time, knew of his disgrace while a member of the
Black Wolf Patrol. Possibly he did not wish to
run a chance of being snubbed; but be that as it
may, when he passed any of the uniformed
youngsters he kept his eyes on the ground. This
did not prevent him, however, from hanging
around when the Scouts were at practice and
making all sorts of contemptuous remarks concerning
their play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>The Saturday before the game, the lads started
out in different directions to put up their bills.
Those whose duties lay within easy distance of
Hampton went on foot; but the others took rigs.
Among the latter were Rob, Merritt and Tubby
Hopkins. With them they carried a good thick
bundle of bills, plenty of paste and long-handled
brushes. It was a beautiful day and they were in
high spirits as they drove along the pleasant
country roads.</p>
<p>Their way took them by Farmer Applegate&rsquo;s
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s plaster up a few on the old grouch&rsquo;s
barn,&rdquo; suggested Merritt with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want to do that,&rdquo; declared Rob
positively, &ldquo;although he isn&rsquo;t entitled to much
consideration. It was a shame the way he
treated Fred Mainwaring&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such a pretty girl, too,&rdquo; chuckled Tubby, with
a mischievous look at Merritt. Rob intercepted
the glance and turned red, at which both his
companions teased him more than ever. Luckily
for Rob&rsquo;s peace of mind, however, at this juncture
something occurred to cause the current of
Tubby&rsquo;s thoughts to flow in another direction.</p>
<p>Beyond the farm buildings a spotted pig was
nosing about contentedly in the middle of the
road. As his eyes lighted on the porker, Tubby
gave a shout of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can use him,&rdquo; he cried delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again. Always thinking about
something to eat,&rdquo; snorted Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; retorted Tubby indignantly;
&ldquo;anyhow, I&rsquo;ve never heard of your being absent
at meal times. But on this occasion it&rsquo;s alive and
in his proper person that Jake is going to be useful
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a living advertisement,&rdquo; chuckled the
stout youth, his round cheeks shaking as he eyed
the unsuspecting Jake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">SOME UP-TO-DATE ADVERTISING.</span></h2>
<p>By the time the buggy drew up alongside Jake,
who was too engrossed in his rooting operations
to perceive it, or at any rate to bestow any attention
upon it, Tubby had disclosed his plan to his
chums, who hailed it with shouts of delight.
From his pockets the fat boy produced an apple
and a bit of cake. Tubby never traveled far
without provisions. &ldquo;Keeping in touch with his
base of supplies,&rdquo; he called it.</p>
<p>It spoke volumes for his enthusiastic belief in
the success of his plan that he was willing to
offer both of these to Jake as soon as he had
alighted from the buggy. Close behind him came
Rob and Merritt, the latter with the horse&rsquo;s
hitching rope in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, pig! pig! pig! Nice Jake!&rdquo; warbled
Tubby in the most dulcet voice he could assume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Jake looked up. His small eyes twinkled.
Unsuspectingly he sniffed the air as he perceived
a rosy apple temptingly held out toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; laughed Rob, half contritely, &ldquo;if
he hadn&rsquo;t caused a lot of trouble for a mighty nice
girl I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig! pig! pig!&rdquo; chortled Tubby persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unk! unk! unk!&rdquo; grunted Jake, wiggling his
tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful how they understand each other,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Merritt with a grin. But
Tubby was too intent on what he had in hand to
resent the gross insult.</p>
<p>Closer and closer shuffled Jake, his greedy
little eyes on the apple. All at once he appeared
to make up his mind in a hurry. He made a dart
for the tempting bait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; yelled Tubby.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, as soon as he heard the preconcerted
signal, Merritt flung the looped hitching
rope about the pig&rsquo;s neck. Jake gave a squeal
and wriggled with might and main, but his ears
held the rope from slipping off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give him the apple to keep him quiet,&rdquo; suggested
Merritt, as Jake squealed at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>Tubby proffered the apple and instantly Jake
forgot his troubles in devouring it. In the meantime
Tubby slipped to the wagon and selected
a poster or two and a brush full of paste.
Returning, amidst shouts of laughter from his
fellow conspirators, he plentifully &ldquo;shampooed&rdquo;
Jake with paste, and then slapped the gaudy
yellow bills on till it appeared as if the astute
Jake had enveloped himself in a bright orange
overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now cut him loose,&rdquo; ordered Rob, when
Tubby, with all the satisfaction of a true artist,
stepped back to view his completed work.</p>
<p>Merritt slipped the noose, and off down the
road toward the farm dashed the gaudily
decorated Jake, conveying the news to all who
might see that on Saturday, April &mdash;, there would
be a Grand Baseball Game at Hampton, Boy
Scouts of The Eagle Patrol <i>vs.</i> The Hampton
Town Nine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>As the boys, shouting and shaking with laughter,
watched this truly original bit of advertising
gallop off down the road, the one touch needed
to complete the picture was filled in. From his
dooryard emerged the farmer. The first thing
his eyes lighted on was Jake. For one instant he
regarded the alarmed animal in wonderment.
Then, with a yell, he rushed into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma! ma! Lucindy!&rdquo; he bellowed at the top of
his voice, &ldquo;Jake&rsquo;s got the yaller fever, er the
jaunders, er suthin&rsquo;. Come on quick! He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;
down ther road like ther Empire State Express,
and as yaller as a bit of corn bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this stage of the proceedings the boys, their
sides shaking with laughter, deemed it prudent
to emulate the Arabs of the poem and &ldquo;silently
steal away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Looking back as they drove off they could see
Lucindy and her spouse engaged in a mad chase
after the overcoated Jake. Even at that distance
the latter&rsquo;s piercing cries reached their ears with
sharp distinctness and added to their merriment.
Rob alone seemed a bit remorseful at the huge
success of Tubby&rsquo;s novel advertising scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Applegate&rsquo;s a pretty old man, fellows,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;and maybe we went a bit too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if his age runs in proportion to his
meanness, he&rsquo;ll outlive Methuselah,&rdquo; declared
Merritt positively.</p>
<p>The road they followed gradually led into a
by-track that joined the main road they had left
with one that traversed the north side of the
island. It was sandy, and at places along its
course high banks towered on each side of it.
At length they emerged from one of these sunken
lanes and found on their right an abandoned
farm. Quite close to the roadside stood a big,
rattletrap-looking barn. It had once been painted
red, but neglect and the weather had caused the
paint to shale off in huge patches, leaving blotches
of bare wood that looked leprous with moss and
lichen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say if we leave a few souvenirs
pasted up there?&rdquo; said Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the looks of the place,
anyhow,&rdquo; decided Rob. &ldquo;I doubt if many people
come along this road anyway; but I guess we
might as well get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you two fellows can do the work this
time,&rdquo; declared Tubby, stretching out luxuriously
in the rig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drive down the road and hitch
up in the shade of that tree and take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty cool!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is, at least it looks so,&rdquo; responded
Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s up to you to do some work,
too,&rdquo; protested Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I hadn&rsquo;t just done a big job in labeling
that pig,&rdquo; replied Tubby, yawning; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your
turn now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Seeing that it was useless to try to turn Tubby
from his determination to rest, which, next to
eating, was his favorite occupation, Rob and
Merritt took up their brushes, paste and a roll of
bills and set out for the barn. Tubby watched
them languidly a minute and then drove off along
the sandy track while the other two clambered up
a bank.</p>
<p>From the road the barn had appeared quite
close; but when they reached the top of the bank
they found that, actually, it stood back quite a
little distance beyond a strip of grass and weeds.
The boys waded through these almost knee-deep,
and finally reached the side of the old barn. They
set down their buckets and brushes and unrolled
some bills preparatory to pasting them up.</p>
<p>Suddenly Merritt raised a warning finger.
Rob instantly divined that his chum enjoined
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; was the word that Merritt&rsquo;s lips
framed rather than spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Inside the barn some one was talking,&mdash;several
persons seemingly. After a minute the boys could
distinguish words above the low hum of the
speakers&rsquo; voices. Suddenly they caught a name:
&ldquo;Mainwaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess maybe we might be interested in this,&rdquo;
whispered Rob.</p>
<p>By a common impulse the two Boy Scouts
moved closer to the moldering wall of the old
barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A BIG SURPRISE.</span></h2>
<p>Time and weather had warped the boards of
the structure till fair-sized cracks gaped here and
there. The boys made for one of these, with the
object of peering into the place and getting a
glance at its occupants. At first they had
thought that these were nothing more than a
gang of tramps, but the name of the engineer,
spoken with a foreign accent, had aroused them
to a sense that, whoever was in the old barn, a
subject was being discussed that might be of
interest to their new friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Applying their eyes to two cracks in the timbers,
they saw that within the barn four persons
were seated. One of these they recognized
almost instantly as Jared Applegate. By his
side sat a youth of about his own age, flashily
dressed, with a general air of cheap smartness
about him. The other two occupants of the place
were of a different type. One was heavily built
and dark in complexion, almost a light coffee
color, in fact. His swarthy face was clean shaven
and heavily jowled. Seated next to him on an
old hay press was a man as dark as he, but
more slender and dapper in appearance. Also he
was younger, not more than thirty, while his
companion was probably in the neighborhood of
fifty, although as powerful and vigorous, so far
as the boys could judge, as a man of half his
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that you have duplicates of Mainwaring&rsquo;s
plans, showing exactly the weakest
points of the great dam?&rdquo; the elder man was
asking, just as the boys assumed positions of listening.</p>
<p>Jared nodded. He glanced at the more slender
of the two foreigners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Mr. Estrada has told you all about
that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear Alverado,&rdquo; the dapper
little man struck in, &ldquo;you recollect that I spoke
to you of Se&ntilde;or Applegate&rsquo;s visit to me at Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob started. The name Estrada, coupled with
a mention of Washington, recalled to his mind
something that sent a thrill through him taken in
connection with the words of the man addressed
as Alverado.</p>
<p>Estrada,&mdash;Jos&eacute; Estrada! That was the name
of the ambassador of a South American republic
that had several times been mentioned as being
opposed to Uncle Sam&rsquo;s plans on the Isthmus.
What if&mdash;but not wishing to miss a word of what
followed, he gave over speculating and applied
himself to listening with all his might. Jared
gave a short, disagreeable laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can just bet I got duplicates of all the
plans,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;I had an idea that Mainwaring
was going to fire me on account of&mdash;well,
of something, and so I went to work and copied
off all of his private papers I could. You see, it
was common talk on the Isthmus that the place
was alive with spies, and I figured out that anybody
who was interested enough to hire spies
must be mighty anxious to get at the real plans
of the canal, and willing to pay big for them,
too,&rdquo; he added with a greedy look on his face,
which for an instant gave him a strong likeness
to his father.</p>
<p>Rob and Merritt exchanged glances. From even
the little that they had heard it was plain enough
what was going forward in the barn. There was
no doubt now that Jared was bargaining with
representatives of a foreign power that had good
reason to dislike Uncle Sam; no question but that
Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s plans, or at least copies of
them, were in the hands of an unscrupulous young
rascal who was willing to sell them to the highest
bidder, without caring for what nefarious purpose
they were to be used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>The Boy Scouts&rsquo; blood fairly boiled as they
heard. They had always known Jared to be weak,
unprincipled and dishonest, but that he would
descend to such rascality as this was almost
beyond belief. Merritt in his anger made a gesture
of shaking his fist. It was an unfortunate
move. A bit of board on which one of his feet
rested gave way with a sharp crack under the
sudden shifting of his weight.</p>
<p>Instantly the men in the barn were on the
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; cried Estrada sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. A rat, I guess; old barns like this
are full of them,&rdquo; rejoined Jared, striving to
appear at ease, but glancing nervously about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rat, bah!&rdquo; exclaimed Alverado, puffing out
his fat jowls till he looked like a huge puff adder.
&ldquo;That was not a rat, <i>amigo</i>, that was a spy. This
barn is not as secret a meeting place as you led
us to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Merritt,&rdquo; whispered Rob, &ldquo;grab up
everything and run for it. They&rsquo;ll be out here
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Swiftly they gathered up their paste, brushes
and bills, and crouching low ran toward what had
been a smoke-house. Hardly had they darted
within its dark and odorous interior when the
conspirators in the barn came rushing out, looking
in every direction. In Alverado&rsquo;s hand something
glittered in the sunlight. The two Boy
Scouts peering out through a knot-hole had no
difficulty in recognizing the object, with an
unpleasant thrill, as an automatic revolver.</p>
<p>They now saw, too, something that they had
been unable to perceive from the back of the
barn. This was a big, red touring car drawn up
close to the antiquated structure. But they had
no time to waste in looking at the car. The movements
of the searching party engrossed their
attention too deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter in every direction,&rdquo; they heard
Alverado order, &ldquo;we must find out if anyone has
been here listening, or if our ears deceived us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt but that the search was to
be a thorough one. Even the chauffeur of the
car, which, the boys noticed in a quick, fleeting
glance, bore no number, joined in the search. They
rushed about like a pack of bloodhounds in every
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is getting pretty warm,&rdquo; whispered Rob;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s plain those chaps are thoroughly alarmed
and don&rsquo;t mean to leave a stone unturned to find
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that unlucky board!&rdquo; groaned Merritt
remorsefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fine specimen of a Scout to
make such a mistake as that,&mdash;at such a critical
time, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was unfortunate; but accidents will happen,&rdquo;
rejoined Rob quickly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no use
crying over spilt milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is a chance that they will overlook
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that, I&rsquo;m afraid. From what
little I saw of Mister Alverado he appears to be
a very painstaking gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re searching the house now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will take them some time; but you
can depend on it that when they&rsquo;ve finished they&rsquo;ll
search the outbuildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and they&rsquo;ve left that chauffeur on guard
outside, too. Not a chance of our getting out of
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless there&rsquo;s another door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracky! Maybe there is. Let&rsquo;s look. But
we&rsquo;ve got to hurry up. Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming out of the house and pointing
over here,&rdquo; cried Rob the next instant.</p>
<p>Both boys desperately sought to find some way
out of the old smoke-house other than by the door
by which they had entered. But no exit offered.
Suddenly Rob had an inspiration. The smoke-house
was roofed like an inverted V. The roof
was covered with shingles. Apparently they
were rotten, for in places the light came through.
One side of the roof faced toward the abandoned
farmhouse; the other faced back upon some
fields. Rob thrust his fist with some violence
against the shingles on the side of the smoke-house
roof that faced the fields. To his joy the
shingles gave way almost like rotten cardboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We&rsquo;ve found a way out,&rdquo; he cried
exultingly, although he was careful not to raise
his voice much above a whisper. He rapidly
enlarged the opening till it was big enough to
crawl through. Luckily the search party had
paused to examine a corn crib that lay between
the smoke-house and the farmhouse, so that the
boys had a few seconds&rsquo; grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, through you go!&rdquo; breathed Rob as
soon as he had pitched out the bills.</p>
<p>Merritt scrambled through with Rob close on
his heels. The apex of the roof, of course,
screened them from view of the party now
approaching the old smoke-house. It was a drop
of not more than three feet to the ground, for
the walls were low, and Rob had, of necessity,
punctured the roof near the eaves.</p>
<p>Ahead of them lay a meadow with a patch of
woods beyond. Rank brush and tall weeds intervened.
But they had to make a dash of some
hundred feet across an open space. Somehow,
just how they never knew, they got across it and
plunged into the brush, making for the woods
beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>At the same instant Alverado and the others
entered the smoke-house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">BASEBALL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they guessed how we made our
escape, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt spoke as the two lads lay crouched in
the thick brush far removed from harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. The fresh breaks in the roof would
show them that. But, beyond that, they are none
the wiser as to our identity, of which I am heartily
glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand that. You don&rsquo;t like the
look of things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merritt,&rdquo; Rob spoke very soberly, laying his
hand on the other&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;it looks to me as if
we&rsquo;ve stumbled on a monumental plot against
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s canal. I don&rsquo;t know much of politics,
but I do know enough to realize that there is a
certain South American republic that thinks that
the Canal Zone was stolen from her by trickery
and deceit. I&rsquo;m sorry to say, too, that I&rsquo;ve
heard that there are interests right here in the
States that agree with her&mdash;people who think that
the opening of the canal will result in enormous
losses to freight, and who would like to see the
canal completion delayed at all costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. You think that the two dark men
were representatives of that republic you mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> one of them was,&rdquo; snapped Rob; &ldquo;he
is its representative at Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Say, Rob, this is a big thing we&rsquo;ve
stumbled upon. We must bring it to the attention
of the proper authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our duty as Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But what steps do you propose to
take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just know yet. We must see Mr.
Mainwaring, of course, first. It will be for him
to decide. But&mdash;horrors, Merritt!&mdash;we&rsquo;ve forgotten
all about Tubby. He&rsquo;s asleep in the rig.
Look, Jared and his friends are piling into the
auto. If they go down that road they are sure to
discover him. They may do him some injury.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>But the next instant both the anxious lads drew
a sigh of relief. Instead of taking the by-road,
the auto struck off across lots along a barely perceptible
and weed-grown track. In a few moments
it was out of sight and the coast was clear. Then,
and not till then, the two Boy Scouts set out to
rejoin Tubby. They found that rotund youth
blissfully sleeping, while the old nag cropped
grass at the roadside. They awakened their
stout comrade and soon took the lees of sleep out
of his eyes by relating all that had passed within
the last hour. Tubby heartily agreed that the
first thing to be done was to put Mr. Mainwaring
on his guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Naturally there was no more thought of bill
posting, and filled with a sense of the duty that
lay before them the three Boy Scouts drove
rapidly back to Hampton. But there a disappointment
awaited them. Mr. Mainwaring had been
called away on business. He had gone west and
would not be back for a week or more. So for
the present the scene in the barn had to be
forgotten, while more immediate matters were
attended to. During the ensuing week nothing
was seen of Jared, but the Saturday afternoon of
the game found him &ldquo;warming up&rdquo; on the ball
field with the orange and black of the Hampton
team on his back.</p>
<p>Rob and Merritt fairly boiled over with indignation
as they watched him. But they decided
not to say anything to him that might put him
on his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him all the rope he wants,&rdquo;
declared Rob. Later he was bitterly to regret the
adoption of this policy.</p>
<p>The grounds began to fill up early. The game
aroused widespread interest in that section of
Long Island. As the local paper put it, &ldquo;red-hot
ball&rdquo; was looked for. Enthusiastic young ladies
were there by the score, waving flags from the
bunches on sale about the field by hawkers. The
grand-stand filled early. Rob&rsquo;s team-mates
noticed his eyes frequently straying in that
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for Lucy Mainwaring,&rdquo; whispered
Tubby to Merritt with a grin on his round and
blooming countenance.</p>
<p>Finally the game was called and soon both
teams were on the field. Hiram, captain of the
Eagles, won the toss and chose to go to bat first.
The game was started. Nelson promptly struck
out. He could not help making a wry face as he
threw down the willow.</p>
<p>A broad grin was on Jared&rsquo;s face. He went
through all sorts of antics, as Andy Bowles came
to bat with a look of grim determination on his
face.</p>
<p>Jared was good; that was a fact which
admitted no blinking, as the Eagles had to
acknowledge. Andy was given first base on balls,
tried to steal second, was thrown out and retired
disgruntled to the bench. The Hampton rooters
began to give their war cry. The Eagle supporters
replied to it bravely. It was early in
the game to be making any predictions. Rob was
third batter. He struck out. Jared&rsquo;s delight was
ill-concealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shut &rsquo;em out,&rdquo; he bragged loudly, not
caring who heard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show the tin soldiers
some pitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Eagle supporters had to admit that things
did not look very roseate, but they consoled themselves
by recollecting the fact that practically the
game had only begun.</p>
<p>Hampton now went to the bat. Merritt occupied
the pitcher&rsquo;s box. He had injured his arm
somewhat in practice, but it was agreed, after a
consultation, to put him up as first pitcher, holding
Rob in reserve till they got the Hampton&rsquo;s
gait. Merritt showed wonderful form. In one,
two, three order he struck out Hampton&rsquo;s batters,
including Jared.</p>
<p>Great was the delight of the Eagles and their
friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Merritt! Good for you! Kr-e-e-e-ee-ee!&rdquo;
was heard on all sides as the Hamptons
came running out to take their positions in the
field.</p>
<p>Merritt felt a glow of pleasure as Rob congratulated
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I can keep it up,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, too; but I&rsquo;d like to have a chance at
Jared,&rdquo; responded Rob.</p>
<p>The Eagles now came to the bat, Rob leading.
Rob was not only a good pitcher but a sure batter.
Whiz-z came Jared&rsquo;s ball. Rob met it and
promptly drove a humming liner into right field.
It was a safe base hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you Eagles!&rdquo; chanted the crowd; those of
them who were not lined up for Hampton, that is.</p>
<p>Rob watched his chance and stole second, to
the huge delight of his team supporters. An ugly
look was on Jared&rsquo;s face. The next batter, Merritt,
received first base on four balls. Cheers and
yells greeted this. Jared&rsquo;s countenance grew
blacker and blacker. He bit his lip impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Suddenly Rob played dangerously off second
base. The Hampton second baseman was close to
him. It was a daring move. Jared saw it in a
flash. The catcher&rsquo;s signal came. He threw the
ball to the Hampton short stop on second base.</p>
<p>But Jared&rsquo;s chagrin at the way his pitching
was being &ldquo;knocked about&rdquo; unsteadied his aim.
He threw wild. The ball passed above the short
stop&rsquo;s outstretched finger tips. Rob darted off
for third base like a jack rabbit.</p>
<p>The right fielder got the ball and shot it to
third base, but, although the ball and Rob seemed
to arrive simultaneously, Rob was hugging the
bag contentedly in the nick of time. This was a
quick, stirring bit of play and brought yells from
the crowd, among whom criticisms of Jared were
freely expressed. He grew pale with rage and
chagrin.</p>
<p>Paul Perkins now came to bat. The dreamy
lad struck out. His apparent unconcern made the
crowd laugh. They laughed even more when
Tubby, having struck out also, calmly picked up
a bit of pie he had been munching when he came
to bat and marched to his seat contentedly chewing
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>At this stage of the game two were out, Merritt
was on second and Rob on third.</p>
<p>Now came the turn of Ernest Thompson, a
big-eyed, serious-looking lad, one of the first
recruits to the Eagle standard and a first-class
scout. Jared was now on the broad grin.
Thompson looked easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, baby-face,&rdquo; chuckled Jared, poising
himself.</p>
<p>An in-curve shot from his hand. Ernest gazed
at it in an uninterested manner and allowed it to
go by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; came the sonorous voice of the
umpire, who was Sim Giles, the postmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-h!&rdquo; yelled the crowd.</p>
<p>The next ball was of the same character. This
time Ernest struck at the ball. He missed and
the crowd yelled again. Jared began to regain
self-confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two,&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The third ball was high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one,&rdquo; declared Sim.</p>
<p>Then came an out-curve. But it was too far
out. Jared was a rather ragged pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball two,&rdquo; called Sim.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jared threw to third base. But, quick
as he was, he didn&rsquo;t catch Rob off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; yelled Higgins, the Hampton
third baseman, as he touched Rob.</p>
<p>The umpire merely waved his hand in what he
deemed a professional manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand years late,&rdquo; chuckled Rob to Higgins.</p>
<p>Jared heard him and flashed him an ugly look.
Hatred gleamed in his eyes. Rob watched him
narrowly and again stole off third.</p>
<p>Bang!&mdash;came a swift straight ball at the
dreamy Ernest. But he was not in &ldquo;a trance,&rdquo;
as Jared had scornfully thought. Crack!&mdash;went
a hot grounder to short stop. Merritt stood fast
at second, but Rob, like an arrow from a bow,
shot off for home. The short stop fired in the
sphere to the catcher as quickly as he could. But
before the ball got there, Rob, his legs working
like pistons, had passed the home plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>What a roar went up then! Flags waved and
cheers resounded among the Eagle sympathizers.</p>
<p>As the cheering died away the catcher, Hollis
Powers, walked into the diamond to confer with
Jared, who showed by his passionate gestures
that he was mad clear through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out or they&rsquo;ll knock you out of the box,&rdquo;
yelled some one.</p>
<p>This did not tend to improve Jared&rsquo;s temper.
But, nevertheless, he struck out the next batter,
Simon Jeffords, which helped in part to restore
his balance. The Eagles then retired to the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Merritt?&rdquo; was eagerly asked
by his comrades before he took the pitcher&rsquo;s
box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, so far. You&rsquo;ll know soon enough
when my wing gets sore,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Apparently Rob was not destined to pitch that
day. Merritt struck out the first two batters,
fielded a hot liner and threw out Jared before he
got to first base. Jared was certainly piling up
his list of grievances against the Boy Scouts. To
add to his ill-feeling he had recognized Fred
Mainwaring, nodded to the latter and received
the cut direct. The fact that Lucy Mainwaring
was a witness to this snub did not improve
matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Merritt!&rdquo; yelled the Eagle supporters
in a frenzy of delight.</p>
<p>The third inning commenced with the Eagles
at the bat. But now Jared appeared to have on
his throwing clothes. The Scout batters couldn&rsquo;t
hammer his pitching at all.</p>
<p>In fact, all that occurred while they succeeded
each other at the bat was a monotonous succession
of calls from the umpire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one. Strike two. You&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The Hampton villagers began to pluck up
heart. They gave Jared warm support and cheers
for his really excellent work and that of his team-mates.
To the somewhat blank astonishment of
the Eagles, they had not been able to find Jared&rsquo;s
pitching at all in this inning. It began to look as
if they were by no means to have things their
own way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">A TEST FOR THE EAGLES.</span></h2>
<p>But Jared was to score still further. He came
to bat confidently at the end of the third inning.
With two of his side out and none on bases, he
knocked a beautiful homer into left field. It
was a really fine drive. The Hampton contingent
went wild. The faces of the Eagle supporters,
too, were cheerful, but anxious. As for Jared, he
beamed, and then as his eyes met Rob&rsquo;s, he gave
the latter a malevolent glance.</p>
<p>At the end of the third inning each side had
scored one run. The Eagles made no runs in the
following three innings, while Hampton scored
two, so that, when the seventh inning began,
things looked rather gloomy for the Scouts. The
score then stood three to one in favor of Hampton
and the town players fairly swelled with
confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>It was already painfully evident that, exercise
his will power as he would, Merritt&rsquo;s arm was
getting sore. He had put redoubled efforts into
his work but the score showed with how little success.
At the beginning of the seventh, he told
Captain Hiram that he thought the Hamptons
had &ldquo;found&rdquo; his pitching, but he consented to
stay in the box for one more inning.</p>
<p>The inning commenced with Merritt at the bat.
He was given first base on balls. Paul Perkins
made a base hit to left field. He got safely to
first with Merritt hugging second. Tubby Hopkins
once more struck out with the same cheerful
grin on his round countenance. Hiram sent a
slow grounder to Jared and was promptly thrown
out at first, but Merritt reached third, and Paul
second, very nicely.</p>
<p>Rob Blake now came to the bat. Jared determined
to strike him out if it were humanly possible.
After a lot of posing which he thought
gave him quite a professional air, Jared delivered
the best ball in his r&eacute;pertoire, a swift and vicious
in-curve. It fairly hissed through the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s willow collided with the sphere and away
it sped far into right field. Merritt and Paul
scored amidst tremendous enthusiasm; hats were
thrown in the air. Things once more looked rosy
for the Eagles. Rob was easily the favorite of
the moment.</p>
<p>As for Jared, his feelings were not enviable.
He felt that he would gladly have allowed the
others to score if he had only been able to shut
Rob out. He struck out the next batter, and then
Hampton went to bat.</p>
<p>Merritt&rsquo;s arm felt better and he went to the
box without the misgivings that had assailed him
earlier. But with the first ball he pitched he knew
that he had deluded himself. The batter hit a
fly to right field and was caught out. Merritt,
summoning every ounce of resolution he could
muster, struggled on right manfully. But it was
a hopeless cause. Base hits were made with
absurd ease. Jared was caught out on a fly.
Finally there were two out and two on bases.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Higgins came to bat and made a second home
run amidst yells of delight from the Scouts&rsquo;
opponents.</p>
<p>It began to look like grim defeat for the Scouts.
The Hampton contingent was jubilant. Jared
danced mockingly about whenever he could catch
the eye of a Boy Scout.</p>
<p>The next Hampton batter struck an easy fly
to left field which was caught by Paul Perkins.
The Scouts now came to the bat, beginning the
eighth inning. The score was six to three in
Hampton&rsquo;s favor. Things looked black, but with
the true Scout spirit the lads of the Eagle put
the best face possible on matters. They noted
Jared&rsquo;s leering face without a sign that they saw
his malignant triumph.</p>
<p>Jared struck out the first three Scout batters
with ridiculous ease. When the Hamptons came
to the bat, the Eagles made a change in pitchers.
It was Rob, cool, self-confident and determined,
who occupied the box. This followed a consultation
at which it was agreed that, splendidly as
Merritt had done, his arm had gone back on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>As Hiram adjusted his catcher&rsquo;s mask and Rob
took his new position, things grew very quiet.
It was palpable to all that the change of pitchers
denoted a crisis in the game for the Scouts. Rob
faced the first batter without indulging in any
of Jared Applegate&rsquo;s antics. Hiram signaled for
a swift one. He braced himself as he saw it
coming. He knew that Rob was a swift pitcher
with a mighty right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; yelled the umpire a fraction of
a second later.</p>
<p>Jared, at the bat, looked angry and puzzled.
He wondered why they hadn&rsquo;t put Rob in the
box at first. He did not know that Rob, while a
splendid pitcher, was not to be relied on through
a long game as was Merritt. Another thing he
didn&rsquo;t know was that Rob had determined with
a grim resolution to snatch victory from the jaws
of defeat, if possible. That&rsquo;s a feeling that will
carry any boy, or man either for that matter, a
long way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Hiram signaled for another cannon-ball. It
was plain that those were just the kind of missiles
that were not at all to Jared&rsquo;s liking.</p>
<p>The ball shot from Rob&rsquo;s hand apparently without
effort. But it shot over the plate like a bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; bellowed the umpire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you Rob!&rdquo; yelled his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-r-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!&rdquo; shrilled the Scouts.</p>
<p>But Rob took no notice; nor did he regard
Jared&rsquo;s look of hatred, oddly mixed with worry.
Rob&rsquo;s pitching bothered him. He wanted no more
off that plate.</p>
<p>But whi-z-z-z-z-z-z! came another &ldquo;cannon
ball&rdquo; like a high powered projectile burning up
the atmosphere. Jared swung wildly an inch too
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Striker&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; came the call of Jared&rsquo;s doom
from the umpire.</p>
<p>It was a furiously angry youth that strode to
the bench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were going to make ducks and
drakes out of him, Jared?&rdquo; grinned one of his
fellow players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was. I was just trying him out,&rdquo; grunted
Jared disgustedly.</p>
<p>The next two batters couldn&rsquo;t handle Rob&rsquo;s
pitching at all. The game began to look as if it
might be retrieved after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blake! Blake! Blake!&rdquo; chanted the crowd as
Rob walked toward the batters&rsquo; bench.</p>
<p>Merritt was first at bat for the Scouts in the
ninth inning. Jared began to pitch with as good
an imitation of Rob&rsquo;s speed as he could muster.
Merritt let the first ball sing past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second, also, went by in similar manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball two!&rdquo; sang out Sim in his high, nasal
voice.</p>
<p>Jared pulled himself together. He sent the
ball humming right over the home plate. Merritt
swung at it and made a safe base hit to right
field. Then came Hiram. He struck out. Jared
and the Hamptonites began to feel better. Jared
was still holding the Scouts down and they had a
safe margin of runs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Paul Perkins struck out this time. Then came
Ernest Thompson, who dreamily submitted to
the same process.</p>
<p>Rob Blake now came to the bat. His exhibition
of pitching just previously earned him a round of
applause. Jared looked positively bilious. He
had actually been holding himself in reserve for
Rob. It was his intention to shut him right out.
Rob ignored Jared&rsquo;s first ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball two!&rdquo; followed in rapid succession. Rob
smiled easily. Jared&rsquo;s dislike of the boy at the
bat was making him irritable and uneasy.</p>
<p>But he rallied his skill and threw what looked
like an easy pitch. Rob struck at it but fanned
the empty air.</p>
<p>Jared grinned, the Hamptonites yelled and the
umpire called:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right for you, Mister Casey at the bat,&rdquo;
snarled Jared, &ldquo;watch out for this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came like a flash, a tricky, wavy curve.
Rob swung with all his strength and&mdash;missed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan went up from the Scout supporters.
Their chances of victory looked slim indeed now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! You&rsquo;re in a trance!&rdquo; scoffed Jared,
grinning at Rob. &ldquo;Get out of the straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The straw in the red barn!&rdquo; suddenly flashed
Rob, in a low, but far-reaching voice. It was
pregnant with meaning and Jared turned white
as death. He fumbled the ball with trembling
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-what do you mean?&rdquo; he managed to
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the crowd impatiently.</p>
<p>Jared, his fright still on him, pitched. He made
a wild fling. Rob trotted to first base. Merritt
boomeranged to second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Simon Jeffords got his base on balls, advancing
Rob to second and Merritt to third. Everybody
began to sit up and take renewed notice. A
home run now would add four to the Scout score.
Could they get it? Jared had shown that he could
hold them down. Could he still keep up his gait?</p>
<p>And now out strolled Tubby Hopkins. He
paused first to insert a huge chunk of chewing
gum in his capacious cheek and then, not noticing
in the least the laughter and joking that greeted
his appearance, he lounged to his place, his jaws
moving rhythmically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you, Tubby. Bring home the
bacon!&rdquo; some one yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the bacon with him,&rdquo; shouted some
other humorist.</p>
<p>Jared fixed his eyes quizzically on Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a bottle of anti-fat, kid?&rdquo; he sneered;
and then, &ldquo;Oh, what I won&rsquo;t do to you! How do
you like &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby stopped chewing an instant. His large
eyes opened wide as if he had just heard Jared&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I like &rsquo;em Panama fashion, if you&rsquo;ve got
any of those about you to-day,&rdquo; he said with a
cherubic smile.</p>
<p>Zang! came the ball. It was as swift as any
that Jared had yet thrown. He would have liked
to see it knock the disconcerting fat youth on the
head. But it did no such thing. With an agility
unsuspected except by those who knew him,
Tubby swung viciously at the spheroid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bin-go!&rdquo; yelled the rooters.</p>
<p>Off into left field a hot liner whizzed its way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; shrieked the Eagles and their supporters,
dancing up and down in excitement.</p>
<p>Off darted Merritt from third. He shot across
the home plate an instant later and scored amidst
loud cheering. Hot after him flashed Rob, with
Simon close behind. Excitement rose to a point
where it was almost unbearable.</p>
<p>Tubby had shot like a stone from a sling the
instant he made his hit. And now more like a
steam roller the fat youth cavorted over the bases
while the crowd went crazy. Pandemonium
reigned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Home! Home! Home!&rdquo; shrieked the raucous
crowd in a frenzy.</p>
<p>Boys hugged each other and the Scouts danced
up and down.</p>
<p>Tubby, with amazing speed, his short fat legs
working like piston rods, flashed by first, second
and third bases. The next instant a yell went up
that split the air. A rotund form sky-hooted
across the home plate and then, tripping up, went
rolling like a tub of butter into the arms of Rob
and his team-mates. Tubby had made one of
the most sensational plays ever seen on the
Hampton field, and foes as well as friends generously
applauded the fat boy. But he paid no
attention to the plaudits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scotland! I&rsquo;ve lost my gum,&rdquo; were his
first words on being helped to his feet. &ldquo;Anybody
got a chew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barrel full, if you want them!&rdquo; yelled the
delighted Scouts, dancing about the boy who had
hit out a home run with bases full.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The next batter, Walter Lonsdale, struck out.
Then the town team went to bat for its last
chance. The score now stood thus:</p>
<p class="center">Eagles: seven. <span class="hst">Hamptons: six</span></p>
<p>Rob resumed his place in the pitcher&rsquo;s box.
Higgins struck out. But Jared got his base on
balls. Maybe Rob was overconfident. Conners
came next. Two strikes had been called on him,
when Rob, like a flash, hurled the ball to first.
With neatness and expedition Jared was put out.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Conners had been so rattled by
Rob&rsquo;s pitching that, when the latter threw to first,
Conners frantically struck at an imaginary ball,
causing a roar of laughter. This disconcerted
him so badly that he missed the next ball and
struck out.</p>
<p>The Scouts had indeed snatched victory from
the jaws of defeat. The game was theirs but by
so narrow a margin that they hardly liked to
think about it.</p>
<p>In an instant the crowd broke all boundaries
and surged about the victorious Eagles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Home-run Tubby!&rdquo; yelled
somebody.</p>
<p>In a flash the fat youth was hoisted on half a
dozen shoulders. Then began a triumphal march
around the field to the music of Andy Bowles&rsquo;
bugle, which he had suddenly produced from
some mysterious hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I knew that I&rsquo;d need it,&rdquo; he explained
afterward.</p>
<p>Rob, arm in arm with Merritt, brought up the
rear of the tumultuous riot of enthusiasts. Suddenly
Rob&rsquo;s eye caught sight of a figure in the
uniform of the Hampton&rsquo;s players sneaking up
behind a corner of the grand-stand which it was
evident the crowd must pass in their march of
victory. It was Jared Applegate. With him was
the same young man the boys had seen in the
barn the week before, as well as two other youths
of bad character in the village, Hodge Berry and
Maxwell Ramsay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mischief is Jared up to?&rdquo; breathed Rob,
clutching Merritt&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but he looks as sneaky as a
pole cat. Let&rsquo;s watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two scouts followed, at a slight distance,
the group of which Jared was the center. They
saw the boys that they were watching sneak in
behind the grand-stand, while Jared stooped and
picked up a heavy stone. As the crowd, with
Tubby&rsquo;s rubicund countenance shining above
their heads, came swinging around the corner on
their way off the ball field, Rob gave a sharp
exclamation and sprang forward.</p>
<p>Like a flash he gripped Jared&rsquo;s arm just as it
was about to launch the stone at Tubby&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you rascal!&rdquo; he managed to exclaim,
forcing Jared&rsquo;s arm down with a firm wrist hold.</p>
<p>The next instant Hodge Berry and Max Ramsay,
both of whom had played in the Hampton
team, sprang at Rob furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get a licking you won&rsquo;t forget
in a hurry,&rdquo; they cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>The crowd had swung on, not noticing the
dramatic scene that was occurring so close to
them. Rob dropped Jared&rsquo;s wrist and turned to
face his opponents.</p>
<p>Something in his face made them halt an
instant, and in that brief space of time Merritt
was at his side. The strange youth who had said
nothing so far now started to speak, but Rob
checked him.</p>
<p>Utterly ignoring the others, he addressed himself
to Jared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get square with you,&rdquo; replied Jared
in a furious tone. He appeared almost beside
himself with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! and so you&rsquo;ve brought a bunch of
your amiable friends along to help you in case
it proved too big a job to tackle alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, stepping
forward a pace, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are except
by name, but I&rsquo;m not going to have you insult
me. Jared here is a chum of mine. I knew him
in New York&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry for you,&rdquo; flashed out Rob curtly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of your lip,&rdquo; growled Max Ramsay
sullenly; and yet, so electrical had the atmosphere
become, and so capable of handling himself did
the clean-living young scout look, that, uneven as
the odds were, no further hostile move was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jared said he had a bone to pick with you,&rdquo;
went on the strange youth. &ldquo;He told us he wanted
to have it out with you Scouts. He invited us
along. I&rsquo;m not going to take any part in it, you
can be assured of that. There&rsquo;ll be fair play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like stone throwing, for instance,&rdquo; retorted
Rob contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re scared,&rdquo; sneered Jared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. You act so. You&rsquo;re afraid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared was quite quick enough to see that Rob
was unwilling to get into a fight. The leader of
the Eagle Patrol abhorred, above all things, to be
mixed up in a disgraceful set-to. But even Rob,
who had unusual self-control, was fast beginning
to lose patience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what harm I&rsquo;ve ever done you,
Jared,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but if you feel so, why
I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate you, Rob Blake,&rdquo; exclaimed Jared
through his clenched teeth, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to
polish you off once and for all,&mdash;do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not deaf. Let us pass, please,&rdquo; said Rob,
still with that same calm, unruffled manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till you&rsquo;ve given me satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared interpreted Rob&rsquo;s manner amiss. He was
sure now that Rob would avoid a fistic discussion
at all hazards. He determined to show his friends
what a terrible person he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you heard what I said,&rdquo; repeated Jared,
thrusting out his jaw and stepping closer to the
unmoved Rob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to give me satisfaction&mdash;understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to fight you?&rdquo; asked Rob,
without the flicker of an eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; whipped out Jared boldly.</p>
<p>At the same instant, thinking to catch Rob off
his guard, he aimed a vicious blow at the lad in
front of him. Rob merely stepped to one side.
Jared almost lost his balance as his fist encountered
thin air, and just saved himself from taking
an ignominious tumble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So; you&rsquo;re a coward, eh?&rdquo; cried Jared furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly that&rsquo;s your opinion,&rdquo; spoke Rob
calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like fighting, Jared, it&rsquo;s not gentlemanly
and it&rsquo;s not a Scout principle; but if you
<i>want fight, you&rsquo;re going to get it!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Merritt, who had stood
silent, well knowing Rob&rsquo;s ability to handle himself,
for the Scouts had many friendly sparring
bouts with the gloves. The noble art of self-defense
was cultivated by all of them, but as a
means of self-defense and for the joy of the sport
only.</p>
<p>Rob whipped off his coat in a jiffy. Jared, with
a slight quiver of his lower lip, did the same.
Both boys stood ready to defend themselves, and,
while the shouts of the crowd bearing Tubby
aloft died away in the distance, the fight, into
which Rob had been unwillingly dragged, began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">SKILL VS. MUSCLE.</span></h2>
<p>Jared was heavily built and strong, but his
science was nothing to boast of. Jared had never
had the application to build himself up physically.
Yet he was no mean opponent, as Rob saw. The
leader of the Eagles was not as heavily muscled
or as weighty as Jared, but he more than made
up for it in his cat-like quickness and ability to
spar.</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s son saw this and realized that his
best opportunity to put a quietus on his hated
opponent was to land a heavy blow before Rob&rsquo;s
perfect training had a chance to assert itself.
He rushed in wildly, determined to battle his way
through Rob&rsquo;s defense and beat him down by
sheer weight and force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>But in this he had reckoned altogether without
his host. Rob cleverly dodged Jared&rsquo;s savage
swings, and, watching his opportunity, countered
with amazing swiftness. None of the onlookers
saw the blow, but they heard the sharp crack of
Rob&rsquo;s knuckles on Jared&rsquo;s jaw. As for Jared, he
beheld a swimming galaxy of brilliant constellations.</p>
<p>Rob saw that he was dazed for an instant and
dropped his hands to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop right here if you like, Jared,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; shouted Jared, shaking
his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t keep on the way you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo;
laughed Merritt cheerfully. Jared&rsquo;s friends began
to look rather gloomy. In their hearts both Max
Ramsay and Hodge Berry felt heartily glad that
they hadn&rsquo;t tackled the Boy Scout.</p>
<p>Once more Jared rushed in on Rob. A second
later his nose stopped a solid blow straight from
the shoulder. It felt to Jared as if he had inadvertently
collided with the rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he yelled in spite of himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Then, losing his head completely, he rushed at
Rob and seized him in a wrestling grip. Rob,
caught off his guard, lost his feet and the two
toppled to the ground, going at it in rough-and-tumble
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent, but not war!&rdquo; cried Merritt as
he danced about.</p>
<p>Over and over they rolled, Jared managing in
this style of battling to get in some heavy blows
that caused Rob to gasp. But in a short time
Rob had Jared fairly howling for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he bawled out, &ldquo;take him away, you
fellows! He&rsquo;s not fighting fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a cry baby,&rdquo; was all the consolation
he got from his friends. &ldquo;Give it to him hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus counseled, Jared made one last effort to
triumph over Rob. He suddenly disengaged
himself and jumped to his feet. Rob was up as
quick as the other and met Jared&rsquo;s last rush
calmly. Jared, by this time, had lost his head
utterly. He waved his arms wildly in a whirlwind
of blows that Rob contented himself by
ducking and dodging. He had no wish to punish
Jared any more severely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Suddenly the battle came to an abrupt termination,
and that through no effort of Rob&rsquo;s. It had
rained the week before, and back of the grandstand
was a depression in which water had gathered
in sufficient quantity to form a small
pond.</p>
<p>His wild evolutions had brought Jared close
to the edge of this miniature lake. The ground
there was muddy and slippery, and, before he
knew what had happened, Jared&rsquo;s feet slipped
from under him. He staggered, clutching at the
air to save himself; but although his friends
rushed forward to help him, they were too late.
With a mighty splash the luckless Jared toppled
backward into the pond.</p>
<p>He was helped out, a truly pitiable object; but
even his friends could not help laughing at him.
Plastered with mud and streaming with water,
his enraged countenance excited nothing but
mirth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Max Ramsay as soon as he
could for laughing, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get you to the buggy,
Jared, and you can drive out home. Good thing
you won&rsquo;t have to go through the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands, Jared,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob impulsively,
for the moment forgetting what they had
overheard at the barn, in his sympathy for
Jared&rsquo;s plight.</p>
<p>He extended his hand, but Jared dashed it
furiously aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you, you&mdash;you tin soldier!&rdquo;
he shouted, shaking with rage, and also with the
chill of his immersion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way about it,&rdquo; rejoined
Rob, as he turned aside and put on his
coat, which Merritt had held for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll be sorrier yet,&rdquo; snarled Jared,
as his friends walked him off toward the shed
where his buggy was tied.</p>
<p>Just then, from across lots, there came a
summons:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Rob! Where have you got to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming right along,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s reply;
&ldquo;wait a second.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>He jammed on his cap and stepped out from
behind the grandstand. Running toward him
was Tubby, who had somehow escaped from his
admirers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; cried Rob, as he saw the lad&rsquo;s
flushed, excited face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you know that note you left for Mr.
Mainwaring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s just got back. He&rsquo;s over in that
auto yonder and asked me to find you as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby pointed to the road on the outskirts of
the village, where a big torpedo-bodied auto was
drawn up. In it was seated a man of past middle
age, with iron-gray hair and keen eyes, who was
watching the boys closely as they came toward
him.</p>
<p>As they drew nearer he got out of the car and
addressed the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait for me, Manning. I&rsquo;ll walk
home,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">FIRE!</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;A most remarkable story; but I happen to
know certain things that fit in with it in every
way. Boys, you have done me a great service
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring paused as he spoke and looked
kindly and admiringly at the three Boy Scouts
who had unfolded to him the story of their
experiences at the old barn. The tale had been
told as they strolled along the road leading to
the engineer&rsquo;s home, on a hill outside Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>It had occupied some time in the telling, and
dusk was drawing in so that, much against their
will, the boys were compelled to decline Mr.
Mainwaring&rsquo;s invitation to visit his library and
see some interesting drawings and data relating
to the Panama Canal. But they made an engagement
to come at some other time and hear from
the great engineer about some of the wonders
that had been accomplished in the magic land
lying nine degrees north of the equator&mdash;a land
which, so far as the Canal Zone is concerned,
has been turned by Uncle Sam&rsquo;s canal commission
into a land as healthful as any, if due
precautions are observed.</p>
<p>It was almost dark as the boys hastened on
their homeward way. There was a meeting
called in the Eagle rooms over the bank that
night, and they were all three in a hurry to get
home and change and eat supper. As they walked
along at a brisk pace, the conversation naturally
was chiefly concerned with the topic which they
had just been discussing with Mr. Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;ll do about it?&rdquo; said Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as he said, it&rsquo;s a mighty delicate matter
as things are now,&rdquo; rejoined Rob. &ldquo;To make a
hasty move might force the plotters to rush
things before any precaution could be taken
against them. Even to take Jared before the
authorities might be premature, so Mr. Mainwaring
said. I gathered, in fact, that he means
to let matters lie quiet for a time and watch every
move of those whom he suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to clap the whole outfit in jail,&rdquo;
sputtered Tubby, &ldquo;and give them nothing to
eat but bread and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last part of that remark would be a fearful
punishment to Tubby, all right,&rdquo; chuckled
Merritt, nudging Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lucky chap Fred Mainwaring is,&rdquo; said
Rob presently. &ldquo;Just think, when his father goes
back to Panama he&rsquo;s to go, too. His dad says
that every American boy who can ought to see
the Big Ditch before the water is in it, and that,
even if Fred does miss some schooling, he will be
getting some education that can&rsquo;t be obtained
from books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; sighed Tubby, who
was a notoriously unwilling worshipper at the
shrine of knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about a cook book?&rdquo; chuckled Merritt
mischievously, and then dodged aside just in
time to avoid a blow from Tubby&rsquo;s chubby fist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, behind them came the sound of
wheels and the staccato rattle of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs
tapping the road at a rapid trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the road, fellows, here comes a rig,&rdquo;
cried Rob.</p>
<p>So fast was it coming that they had hardly
time to step aside before the buggy, which held
two occupants, was beside them. The driver
pulled the horse up almost on its haunches and
hailed them as they stood in the dark shadow of
some big maples at the side of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you fellows! Got the time? We&rsquo;ve got
to make that seven-thirty train out of Hampton
and my watch is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob, and his companions, too, recognized the
voice instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just seven o&rsquo;clock, Jared,&rdquo; said Rob,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confusion,&rdquo; muttered another voice in the
rig, that of the strange young man who now
appeared to be Jared&rsquo;s shadow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those Boy
Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared picked up his whip and aimed a vicious
slash into the darkness. It is not likely that he
had any hope of striking one of the lads he disliked
so much, but he intended it probably just
to show his hatred of them in a graphic manner.
The next instant the same whip cracked over the
flanks of his horse and the buggy dashed off
into the gathering gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Rob, &ldquo;so Jared is going to
beat a retreat, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it. I saw a suit case strapped on
the back of that rig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? By what right? What excuse could
we offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; but just the same it looks as if he&rsquo;s
going to give Mr. Mainwaring the slip and join
those plotters some place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; admitted Merritt. &ldquo;I
guess we ought to call up Mr. Mainwaring and
ask him if there is anything we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, Merritt. At any rate,
having done that, we shall have performed our
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the words left his lips before there
came booming out on the night air a sound that
thrilled them all to the heart. Clear and loud,
with a note of clamorous terror, there came
winging toward them the clang of the fire alarm!
Stroke after stroke struck with a heavy hammer
on the tire of an old locomotive wheel&mdash;that was
the only alarm Hampton boasted. The wheel
hung outside the fire house of the Vigilant Engine
Company Number One. There was no
Number Two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz, fellows! The fire alarm!&rdquo; cried
Tubby, pulling up short in the road.</p>
<p>They stood breathlessly listening, while out on
the dusk the clamorous notes of the steel tocsin
went clanging and jangling. A thrilling, soul-stirring
cry at any time, it was doubly so to these
lads, members of a body enlisted in the cause of
helping those who needed aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>They were standing on the main street at a
point where the stores and business houses had
given place to residences surrounded by lawns
and trees. Out of the houses there came rushing
men and women and children, all in high excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; cried some of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; came back in a dozen voices.</p>
<p>But nobody knew accurately. Suddenly a man,
hatless and coatless, came sprinting up the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &rsquo;cademy!&rdquo; he was yelling, &ldquo;the
&rsquo;cademy&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Academy!&rdquo; gasped Rob, aghast at the
thought that the private school which most of
the boys enrolled as Scouts attended was in
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to do something and do it quick!&rdquo;
he cried the next instant. &ldquo;Merritt, run as quick
as you can to Andy&rsquo;s house. Tell him to sound
the Assembly. There&rsquo;s lots of work for the
Eagles to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>A boy that Merritt knew was hastening by on
a bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me your wheel for Scout duty, will
you?&rdquo; asked Merritt breathlessly.</p>
<p>The boy eagerly assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ll need all the help they can get,&rdquo;
he volunteered as Merritt sprinted off up the
street, &ldquo;my pop has been on the &rsquo;phone and they
say it&rsquo;s a mighty bad blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed an eternity, but in reality it was only
a few minutes before Merritt reached Andy&rsquo;s
home. The little bugler was just rushing out as
Merritt dashed up. They almost collided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound the assembly!&rdquo; panted Merritt. &ldquo;The
Academy&rsquo;s on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wait a second. I knew of the fire
and was going to get hold of Rob for instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Andy darted back to the house. He was out
again in a flash and sounding the sharp, clear
notes of the assembly call. Then came another
urgent summons, the quick, imperative &ldquo;fire
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There go the firemen on the run,&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy, as several of the Vigilants dashed by the
house. &ldquo;Come on, Merritt; the others will all
beat it to the fire-house at top speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rob&rsquo;s already there, I guess,&rdquo; panted Merritt
as they ran side by side, balancing the bicycle.
As they proceeded, Boy Scouts came from some
of the houses and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Academy! The Academy&rsquo;s on fire,&rdquo; they
shouted.</p>
<p>Against the darkening sky a red gush of flame
leaped up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; implored Merritt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
going up like a pack of fire-works. We&rsquo;ve got
to hustle if we want to be of any use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">A SCOUT HERO.</span></h2>
<p>At the fire-house they found Rob and Tubby
helping to drag out the antiquated apparatus
which was the best that Hampton boasted. Glad
enough of the aid of the Boy Scouts, the firemen
greeted them warmly. They recalled a former
occasion when the khaki-clad lads had been of
signal service to them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, while some of the men hitched up
a pair of bony old nags to the engine, and others
got the fire lighted, the hose cart was rushed out
and the ropes unraveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in, boys,&rdquo; shouted Rob.</p>
<p>They obeyed his order with military promptitude.
The long rope was swiftly seized. Rob
was in front, as became the leader of the troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave!&rdquo; shouted Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Like one boy the Eagles bent to the work. Off
they scampered down the street, Andy&rsquo;s bugle
calling to clear the way. Men and women on
their way to the fire scattered to right and left
as the hose cart came lumbering along, drawn by
its willing young escort at almost as fast a gait
as horses could have dragged it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ray for the Boy Scouts,&rdquo; shrilled a small
boy.</p>
<p>The excited crowd took up the cry as the hose
cart went roaring by, speeding toward the sinister
glow on the sky ahead of them.</p>
<p>A throng rushed behind it, making believe to
aid greatly by pushing the lumbering vehicle.</p>
<p>Suddenly a terrible thought flashed across
Rob&rsquo;s mind. The house occupied by the janitor
of the school was undergoing extensive repairs
and he and his family had been given temporary
quarters in some rooms at the top of the school
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>The sudden realization of this sent a thrill
shooting through the boy. What if they were
caught in a fiery trap, unable to escape?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope they are all right,&rdquo; Rob found
himself muttering half aloud as at the head of a
line of straining boys he galloped along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Here comes the engine,&rdquo; went up a
sudden shout from the crowd behind.</p>
<p>Glancing back Rob saw the engine, the pride
of the Vigilants, coming careening down the
street. Its whistle wailed in a melancholy fashion
and from its stack there streamed sparks in
sufficient volume to render timid folks apprehensive
that another fire would be started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull out! Pull out!&rdquo; cried Rob, as he saw it,
&ldquo;here comes the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no need to tell his followers that.
Every boy in the village knew the old Vigilant
and had seen it go screeching and lurching to a
dozen fires. They rushed the hose cart up on the
sidewalk as the engine came swinging nearer. It
looked quite inspiring with its flaming stack,
hissing jets of steam and thunder of horses&rsquo;
hoofs. The driver, Ed Blossom, was belaboring
his steeds furiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Suddenly, out into the middle of the road
darted a tiny little girl. In the excitement and
confusion no one noticed her at first. She stood
there apparently oblivious of the approaching
fire engine for one instant. Then, although
she saw her doom thundering down on her, she
still stood as helplessly as a tiny bird fascinated
by a glowing-eyed serpent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the way! Run! Run!&rdquo; shrieked a
dozen frenzied voices as several people perceived
the child&rsquo;s danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scotland! She&rsquo;ll be killed,&rdquo; cried Merritt.</p>
<p>The engine was almost opposite the hose cart
as the Scouts took in the scene, but with one
spring Merritt darted right in the path of the
heavy machine. It happened so quickly that no
one quite knew what had happened until they saw
a second figure in the path of the Juggernaut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>To snatch up the child was the work of an
instant; but in that instant, as a groan from the
horror-stricken onlookers testified, it looked as if
Merritt&rsquo;s doom had been sealed.</p>
<p>Ed Blossom tugged frantically at his horses&rsquo;
bits and swerved them a trifle as he saw what
was before him. As Merritt sprang backward
with the agility of an acrobat, clasping the child
in his arms, Ed succeeded in swinging just a
little more. The horses grazed Merritt as they
snorted and reared.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a crash and a loud, tearing,
ripping sound and the rear of the fire-engine
was seen to collapse on one side. In pulling out
to avoid running down Merritt and the little girl,
Ed Blossom had quite forgotten, under the stress
of the moment, the trees that grew on each side
of the road. The hub of the rear wheel had
struck one of these and the wheel had been torn
off completely. If Ed had not been strapped to
his seat he would have been hurled to the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>A half hysterical woman fell on Merritt&rsquo;s neck
and covered him with tearful thanks. Then she
snatched up the child and vanished in the crowd,
leaving the Boy Scout free and greatly relieved
that her gratitude was to be spared him just at
that time.</p>
<p>There was a quick hand-clasp from Rob, &ldquo;Well
done, old man.&rdquo; And then they all turned toward
the wreck of the engine. Steam was hissing in
clouds from the crippled bit of apparatus. Merritt
heard someone say that the pump had been
broken. He knew then that the engine was out
of commission for that night.</p>
<p>Men had already unhitched the plunging
horses and tied them to a tree. But it was soon
evident that the engine must lie where it was for
the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do nawthin&rsquo; with her,&rdquo; decided the
foreman and Ed Blossom, after a necessarily
hurried examination, &ldquo;but say,&rdquo; continued the
foreman, enthusiastically, as if the breakage of
the engine was only a secondary consideration,
&ldquo;that rescue of the little gal was as plucky a
thing as I ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>And there was no one in that crowd who did
not agree with him. But there was no time to
linger by the engine. The thing to be done was
to push on to the fire. The crowd rushed along
and the foreman stopped to say to Rob aside:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys must help us keep the crowd back
while we form a bucket line; it&rsquo;s our only chance
to save the place now&mdash;and a mighty slim one,&rdquo;
he added, as again a red tongue of flame slashed
the dark firmament like a scarlet scimitar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the last of the old &rsquo;cademy!&rdquo; cried
a man as he saw. &ldquo;In an hour&rsquo;s time there won&rsquo;t
be a stick of it left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the engine to pump a stream through
the pipes, the hose cart was useless and was abandoned
where it rested. Under the foreman&rsquo;s
directions the Boy Scouts invaded houses and
borrowed and commandeered every bucket, pail
or can they could find. Everything that would
hold water was rushed to the scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>There was a creek opposite the blazing Academy,
and while the Boy Scouts held back the
crowd the firemen formed a double line and
passed the filled utensils rapidly from hand to
hand. As fast as they were emptied they came
back again to be refilled by those at the creek end
of the line. With improvised staves, cut and
broken from shrubs, the boys held the crowd
back. The method was this: each lad held the
ends of two staves, the other ends of which
were grasped by his comrades on either side of
him. This formed a sort of fence and to the
credit of the Hampton citizens be it said they
had too much respect for the good work of the
Boy Scouts to try and press forward unduly.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts were on duty now. Alert,
watchful, aching to be taking part in the active
scene before them, they schooled themselves into
doing their best in the&mdash;by comparison&mdash;hum-drum
task assigned to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The Academy, an aged brick building, was
wreathed in flames. From the cupola on top,
from which had sounded for so many years the
morning summons to study, was spouting vivid
fire. They could see Dr. Ezekiel Jones, the head
of the school, and some of the other instructors
running about in the brilliantly lighted grounds
and saving armfuls of books and papers. The
fire appeared to be on the middle floors. At any
rate up to this time it had been possible for the
men bent on saving what they could to dart in
at the big front doors, reappearing with what
they had been able to salvage from the flames.</p>
<p>With the pitifully inadequate means at their
command, the firemen could do little more than
work like fiends at passing buckets. It was necessary
to be doing something, but even the stoutest
hearted and most hopeful of the onlookers knew
that the case was hopeless.</p>
<p>Suddenly there appeared, from no one knew
exactly where, a little pale-faced man with sandy
whiskers. He wore overalls and was hatless.
A woman, a white-faced woman, clung to his
arm desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Eben,&rdquo; she kept screaming, &ldquo;not you, too!
Not you, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, Jane!&rdquo; the pallid little man kept
shouting in reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our baby, we&rsquo;ve got to
get him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a struggle toward the blazing building,
but the woman clung to him frenziedly.
Now a fireman rushed at him and added his
strength to the woman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scotland,&rdquo; gasped Merritt, who stood
next to Rob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s old Duffy, the janitor, and his
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Rob, without replying, as a
fireman hastened past him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her baby. She&rsquo;s left it in the &rsquo;cademy,&rdquo; came
the choking answer. The man, whose face was
white with helpless horror, hurried on to obey
some order, while a shudder of sympathy and
fear ran through the crowd. Now came more
details as men hastened back and forth. The
woman, thinking that her husband had the baby,
had rushed from the house at the first alarm.
For his part, old Duffy, the janitor, never dreaming
that the fire would gain such rapid headway,
had tried to fight it alone, thinking all the time
that his wife had the infant. The true situation
had just been discovered and the man was frantic
to get back into the place although he was a semi-invalid,
known to suffer with heart disease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>The flames were leaping up more savagely
every minute. For all the effect that the feeble
dribble supplied by the bucket brigade had, they
might as well have given up their efforts.</p>
<p>Rob felt his heart give a bound as he watched
the janitor and his wife kindly, but firmly, forced
back.</p>
<p>His pulses throbbed wildly. He gave one look
at the red inferno before him. Then,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, spread your arms and take my place
in line,&rdquo; he snapped out suddenly to Merritt.</p>
<p>The next instant his lithe young figure darted
across the flame-lit open space in front of the
school. He knew the interior of the old building
like a book, and that would aid him in the task
he had steeled himself to perform. He rushed up
to the group about the shrieking woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What room is your child in?&rdquo; he cried, his
heart seeming to rise in his throat and choke
back the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one on the south corner,&rdquo; cried the
woman mechanically, staring at him with frightened
eyes. &ldquo;See, the flames are getting nearer
to it! Oh, my baby! My baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a terrible scream and sank back. Had
they not caught her she would have fallen. When
she opened her eyes again there was a roar all
about her that was not the roar of the flames.</p>
<p>It was the tremendous, awe-stricken turmoil of
the crowd. They had seen a boyish figure dart
from the fainting woman&rsquo;s side, shake off a
dozen detaining hands, and then, wrapping his
coat about his head, dash by a back entrance
into the burning building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>As he flung open the door and vanished, a
great puff of smoke rolled out. The cry of awed
admiration for such bravery changed to a groan
of despair,&mdash;the terrible voice of massed human
beings seeing a lad go to his death. For, as the
flames crackled upward more relentlessly than
before, it did not seem within the bounds of possibility
that anyone could enter the place and
emerge alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRE TEST.</span></h2>
<p>Touched with reckless bravery, foolhardiness
in fact, as Rob&rsquo;s act had appeared to be, yet he
had not acted without taking due thought. As
always in emergencies, his mind worked with
great swiftness. He had no sooner made up his
mind that it was his duty, cost what it might, to
save that innocent little one&rsquo;s life, than he had
hit upon a plan.</p>
<p>If the child was lodged in the center of the
building, he knew full well that long before its
life must have been yielded up to the fire demon.
But if the quarters of the janitor were, as he
believed, in the south corner of the school, then
there was still a chance. The mother&rsquo;s words
had put him out of all doubt on this score and
Rob instantly determined to face the most daring
act of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>The rooms at the south side of the building
had been used by the Academy boys as a gymnasium
before their present quarters were built,
so that Rob was thoroughly familiar with the
stairways leading to them. So far as he could
see it would be possible, by using a side door,
to dodge the flames shooting up the center of the
building. There was a winding stairway that
existed on this side of the structure quite independent
of the main flight which, by this time,
must have fallen in.</p>
<p>With Rob, to arrive at a decision was to act
upon it. As we have seen, he had lost no time
in making for the doorway. He had, in fact, a
double reason for his haste. For one thing, every
second would count, and, for another, he realized
that to many in the crowd his act would appear
to border on madness, and that an attempt might
be made to hold him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s a fool!&rdquo; yelled someone in the crowd
behind Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Quick as a flash Rob&rsquo;s chum faced around,
indignation shining in his eyes, which had, a
second before, been dimmed with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; however Rob makes out, he&rsquo;s a hero,&rdquo;
he shot back, while a murmur of approbation ran
through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your places, boys,&rdquo; he ordered the next
instant, for the Scouts, half wild with anxiety
and excitement, were beginning to waver and
allow the crowd to surge forward. Merritt&rsquo;s
words stiffened them. In a moment they were
recalled to a sense of that duty of which they had
just witnessed such a conspicuous example.</p>
<p>The instant Rob crossed the threshold of that
door he found himself surrounded by smoke.
But he bent low, and throwing his coat more
closely above his head, he crouched on all fours
so as to get below the level of the acrid fumes
that made his eyes smart cruelly. Suddenly he
stumbled over something, and as he saw in the
dim light what it was he gave a glad gasp. It
was a bucket of water, left on the stairway after
the regular Saturday scrubbing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Rob was a Scout who knew, from careful study
of his Manual, just what to do in emergencies.
He recalled now that in case of being compelled
to enter a smoky, blazing building, it was recommended
to bind a wet cloth over mouth and nostrils
in such a way as to act as a respirator. Instantly
he saturated his handkerchief in the water
and bound it on his face in the manner advocated.</p>
<p>Then he began what was to prove a terrible
climb. The school was three stories in height,
the lower two floors containing study rooms and
offices and the top floor lumber rooms and the
apartments occupied temporarily by the janitor.</p>
<p>Breathing with more ease now that he had
bound up his face, Rob fought his way upward.
It was as murky as a pit, and it seemed that the
stairs were interminable. Suddenly he stumbled
and fell headlong. He had gained the first landing.
Through a door opening upon it jets of
flame, like serpents&rsquo; tongues, were beginning to
shoot. Rob staggered toward the door and
slammed it to. He knew that this was absolutely
necessary, for in the case of the staircase
being in flames when it came time for him
to retrace his steps his retreat would be cut off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>But that was a thought he did not dare to
dwell upon. Steeling himself anew he pushed
stubbornly on to the next flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I know this place as well as I
do,&rdquo; he thought, as he gamely kept up the fight
against what appeared almost overwhelming
odds.</p>
<p>As he climbed higher it grew hotter. The
place was like the interior of a volcano. Beyond
the wall of the stairway Rob could hear the flames
roaring like the beat of the surf on a rocky coast.
It almost seemed as if the fire demon possessed
an articulate voice and was howling his rage
and defiance at the boy who had dared to face
his terrors. But, hot as it was growing, Rob
yet found some small grain of comfort in the
fact that the smoke was not so thick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>He breathed more freely even if his throat
was becoming dry as dust and whistled in an
odd way as he climbed higher. At last he reached
the summit of the second flight.</p>
<p>He paused irresolutely on the landing. Several
doors opened off it. Now that he was actually
there, Rob was confused for an instant. He
was not quite so sure of his bearings as he had
thought he would be. But the roar of the flames
below and about him warned him to lose not a
second of precious time in procrastination.</p>
<p>He plunged into the door nearest at hand.
Within he found himself in a room which was
evidently a dining room. Supper was ready
spread on the table. A lamp illumined the scene.
How odd it seemed to be gazing at this peaceful
domestic setting, while below and to one side of
him, devouring flames were roaring and leaping.
Save for a strong smell of smoke and a slight
bluish haze, the room might have been a thousand
miles away from the flaming building in
which it was located.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Suddenly, as the boy stood there looking swiftly
about him, there came a crash that shook the
whole place like an earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A floor&rsquo;s fallen!&rdquo; gasped Rob. &ldquo;Pray heaven
it&rsquo;s not taken any part of that stairway with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brave as he was, the young scout turned pale
and actually shook for an instant like a leaf.
He knew full well that if that stairway, or any
part of it, was gone, he was doomed to die as
irrevocably as if a death sentence had been pronounced
upon him. All at once, from a room
opening off the dining room came a wailing cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muvver! Muvver, I&rsquo;se fwightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s heart gave a quick bound and he galvanized
into instant action, a great contrast to
his temporary state of stupefaction!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, youngster. Don&rsquo;t cry, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo;
he called out, plunging forward.</p>
<p>Inside the room was a small crib, with a child
about three years old lying on it clasping a doll
in her arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s oo?&rdquo; she demanded in some alarm, as
Rob, with his handkerchief tied over his face,
advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Why&mdash;why, I&rsquo;m a fireman,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rob; and then, with an inspiration, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play
that the place is on fire and I&rsquo;m going to save
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child clapped her hands and her eyes
shone. Rob picked her out of her crib and carried
her tenderly out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to cover your face just like
real firemen do,&rdquo; he said, as they emerged on
the landing and the hot breath of the furnace
below was spewed up at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is dat in de game,&rdquo; inquired the child doubtfully,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; will oo cover dolly&rsquo;s, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all part of the game,&rdquo; Rob reassured
her. &ldquo;Now then, there we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He enveloped the child in his coat which he
had already removed and started for the landing.
Suddenly he stopped, and from under the coat
came a muffled but inquisitive voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is &rsquo;oo cwyin&rsquo;, Mister Fireman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>No, Rob was not crying; but he had just seen
something that made his breath come heavingly
and his heart almost stop beating. Below him he
could see a dull red glow, growing momentarily
brighter. No need was there for him to speculate
on what that meant.</p>
<p>The stairway was on fire. His one means of
escape from the blazing building was cut off.</p>
<p>For an instant Rob&rsquo;s head swam dizzily. He
felt sick and shaky. Was he to die there in that
inferno of flames? A cry was forced wildly from
his cracked lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like this! Oh, not like this!&rdquo; he begged,
raising his eyes upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">IN PERIL OF HIS LIFE.</span></h2>
<p>In the meantime, outside the building suspense
had reached almost the breaking point. The
Scouts still stood steady and staunch, but their
faces were white and drawn. When the crash
that announced the falling floor came, a man,
wrought beyond the bearing point, cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes his last chance, poor kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; breathed a fierce, tense
voice in his ear the next instant. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
his father and mother back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only too true. Attracted by the excitement,
Rob&rsquo;s father and mother had driven to the
scene in their car. They reached it just in time
to hear of Rob&rsquo;s heroic act. Now, white-faced
and trembling, they sat hand in hand wretchedly
waiting for news. As time passed and the flames
rose higher without a sign of the daring lad,
their hearts almost ceased to beat. Seconds
seemed hours, minutes eternity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Then suddenly came a fearful cry. On the
roof there had appeared the figure of Rob with
a bundle which the crowd readily guessed to be
the janitor&rsquo;s child clasped tightly in his arms.
The flames, leaping from the cupola, illumined
his form brightly and showed his pale, tense face.
Thwarted in his effort to descend by the stairway,
Rob had managed to reach the roof through
a scuttle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it! Hurrah! The boy&rsquo;s saved the
baby!&rdquo; went up an ear-splitting cry from the unthinking
in the crowd.</p>
<p>The others knew only too well that the reason
that Rob had appeared on the roof betokened
the terrible fact that his escape had been cut off.
He was making a last desperate stand, with the
flames drawing closer, and threatening to burst
through the roof at any moment.</p>
<p>Every eye in that crowd was fixed on the solitary
figure on the roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ladders! Get ladders,&rdquo; yelled the foreman,
hoping against hope that one could be found
tall enough to reach to that height.</p>
<p>Rob came forward to the cornice, and looked
over as if gauging the height. They saw him
shake his head. Then he looked behind him.
Alas, there, too, all hope of escape was cut off.
Between himself and an iron fire-escape at the
back of the building, tongues of flame were now
shooting through the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s shouting something. Keep still, for
heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; came Merritt&rsquo;s voice suddenly.</p>
<p>A death-like silence followed. Then above the
roar and crackle came a faint sound. It was Rob
calling out some commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rope!&mdash;shoot it up here,&rdquo; was all they could
distinguish.</p>
<p>Merritt darted forward and stood below the
walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louder, Rob! Louder!&rdquo; he besought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A rope! Bow&mdash;arrow&mdash;shoot it up!&rdquo; came
Rob&rsquo;s voice, audible to few, but his chum Merritt
was the only one that understood. He was back
among the Scouts in a flash. He seized Paul
Perkins by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul, your house is nearest. Run! Run as
you never ran before and get your archery bow
and lots of arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul didn&rsquo;t stop to ask the meaning of this
strange command, but darted off at top speed, the
crowd opening for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ropes! Ropes and lots of string!&rdquo; shouted
Merritt next, appealing to the throng. Those
who were closest realized that a plan to save
Rob&mdash;although what it was they couldn&rsquo;t imagine&mdash;was
to be tried. Neighbors of the Academy
ran off at once and in a few minutes the Scouts
were busy, under Merritt&rsquo;s directions, knotting
ropes together to form one long line.</p>
<p>When this had been done, Merritt measured
with his eye the height of the Academy walls.
Then he set them to work knotting light twine
together in as long a line as they could make.
By this time Paul was back with the bow and
arrow that the Scouts used at archery practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it here,&rdquo; ordered Merritt tersely if ungrammatically.</p>
<p>What he was going to try was a repetition
of the trick that had rescued some of the Eagle
Patrol when they were imprisoned on the top
of Ruby Glow in the Adirondacks on their
memorable treasure hunt.</p>
<p>With a hand that was far from steady, Merritt
knotted the end of the light string to an arrow.
Then, placing the arrow in position, he drew the
bow. It was plain enough to the dullest-witted
now what he meant to do. His plan was to shoot
the arrow, with the string attached, up on the
roof where Rob could seize it. This done, it
would be possible for the latter&mdash;if he had time&mdash;to
haul up the rope, knot it to a chimney and
slide down. It was a daring, desperate plan, but
none other offered, and the fact that Rob had
suggested it showed that his nerve was not likely
to fail him in what might be aptly described as
a supreme test.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Amid a dead silence Merritt let the arrow
fly. It shot through the air, but instead of reaching
the roof it struck the wall and rebounded. A
cry went up from the watching crowd as it fell,
having failed to accomplish its purpose. If Rob&rsquo;s
face changed as he stood up there on the edge
of the fire-illumined roof, it was not visible to
those below him, keen as his disappointment must
have been.</p>
<p>But Merritt was almost sobbing as he picked
up the arrow and fitted it afresh for another
trial. As he drew the bow with every ounce of
strength he possessed, his lips moved in prayer
that his next effort might be successful. At
any moment now, the foreman of the fire-fighters
told him, the roof might collapse, carrying with
it the brave boy and his childish burden.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of the crowd, too, a white-faced
man and woman were imploring Divine
Providence to nerve Merritt&rsquo;s arm and aim. For
one instant the bowstring was drawn taut till
it seemed that the bow must snap under the
terrific pressure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Then suddenly the string fell slack, the arrow
whizzed through the air and a mighty cheer split
the sky as it winged true and swift to the roof
top, falling almost at Rob&rsquo;s feet. Hand over hand
he drew in the string, and at last he had hauled
up enough rope to knot one end fast about some
ornamental stone work at a corner of the building.</p>
<div class="img" id="p130">
<img src="images/p130.jpg" alt="The Arrow whizzed through the air * * * *, falling almost at Rob&rsquo;s feet." width="500" height="751" />
<p class="center">The Arrow whizzed through the air * * * *, falling almost at Rob&rsquo;s feet.</p>
</div>
<p>While doing this he had laid the child down.
Now he was seen to pick her up again, and
holding her in his arms for an instant he appeared
to consider. To slide down that rope he
must have at least one arm free. How was he
going to do it? The crowd almost forebore to
breathe as they sensed what the boy on the roof
was puzzling over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>It was Rob&rsquo;s scout training that solved the
problem&mdash;one of life and death for him&mdash;as this
same training is doing all over the world for
lads in every grade of life to-day. He was seen
to give the child some emphatic instructions and
then throw her over his left shoulder much as
he might have done with a bag of meal. In this
position the child&rsquo;s head hung down between his
shoulders. Her legs were across his chest.</p>
<p>Seizing the baby&rsquo;s left arm so that it came
over his right shoulder, Rob extended his left
hand between its knees and grasped the little
one&rsquo;s wrist firmly. In this position she was held
perfectly securely in what all Boy Scouts know
as &ldquo;The Fireman&rsquo;s Lift,&rdquo; one of the most useful
accomplishments a Boy Scout can master.</p>
<p>This done, the most difficult, dangerous part
of Rob&rsquo;s task came. He had to slide down that
rope with his burden on his shoulder with only
his right arm and his legs to depend on for a
grip. But it had to be done. Without hesitation
he swung himself from the coping and
gripped the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>For one terrible instant he shot down for a
foot or so before he succeeded in checking his
downward plunge. But his knees gripped the
rope and his right arm stood the strain, although
he felt as if it must snap.</p>
<p>How he reached the ground Rob never knew.
Those last terrible moments on the roof had come
very near to breaking his nerve. He was conscious
of a sudden flare of light and a crash as
his feet touched the ground. It crossed his mind
hazily that part of the roof must have fallen in&mdash;perhaps
the part on which he had been standing.
Then came a rush of feet, shouts, cries, and arms
flung about him, and through it all Rob could
hear his mother&rsquo;s glad cry of relief after the
awful tension she had endured. He tried to say
something and failed, and then everything raced
round and round him at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainting!&rdquo; he was conscious that somebody
was shouting, and he could hear himself,
only it seemed like somebody else, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; and then everything grew
blank to the Boy Scout who had won, through
&ldquo;Being Prepared&rdquo; for a great emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE ENEMY&rsquo;S MOVE.</span></h2>
<p>Rob Blake was sitting on the porch of his home
in Hampton. In his hand was a book on Woodcraft.
But he was not just now devoting his
attention to the volume. Instead he let it hang
idly from one hand while he gazed up through
the maple tops and dreamed of many things. As
Rob himself would have put it, the &ldquo;spring was
in his blood.&rdquo; More strongly than usual that
morning he felt the &ldquo;red gods calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly two hands were thrown over his eyes
from behind and a voice cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, you leader of the Eagles! That&rsquo;s
one time you&rsquo;re caught napping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tubby!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, springing up and
facing round.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you get in?&rdquo; he asked
the next minute. &ldquo;I never heard you coming,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with a laugh as his eyes fell on
a big section of apple pie with one crescent-shaped
bite missing, that the fat boy was regarding affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. The back door, eh?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; drawled Tubby, &ldquo;and I must say your
cook makes good pie and is inclined to look favorably
on a starving Scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starving! Why, it&rsquo;s not two hours since
breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, two hours is a long time&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo;
mumbled Tubby, who had taken another bite
while Rob was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news from the Academy, Tubby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard? They haven&rsquo;t been able
to find another building big enough to house the
scholars, so I guess it&rsquo;s a holiday till the beginning
of September for all of us,&rdquo; cried Tubby
with shining eyes. &ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s that? A
Latin grammar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>He picked up a volume that lay on an adjoining
chair. He regarded it attentively for a
few seconds and then flung it forth into the
garden where it landed in a rose bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it lie there till September,&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Well, how are you anyhow, old fellow?&rdquo; he
rattled on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a week since the fire and you
ought to be feeling fit again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never felt better in my life, although I was
knocked out quite a bit; but you see I&rsquo;ve had
very good care, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Lucy Mainwaring has been to see you&mdash;once
or twice, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; and Tubby, with
an air of apparent abstraction, fell to studying a
white cloud that happened to be drifting by far
above them. Suddenly he faced about with a
mischievous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked sort of pale when I came in, Rob,&rdquo;
he chuckled, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got plenty of color now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob, boy-like, looked embarrassed and changed
the subject rather abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything fixed for that meeting at headquarters
to-night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>A rather odd look passed over the fat boy&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it&rsquo;s all ready,&rdquo; he said with rather a
marked emphasis on the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good; you and Merritt must have worked
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all taken our part. The hall looks
bully. It&rsquo;ll be dandy to have you around again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting the boys referred to was the
regular weekly meeting of the patrol. But when
Rob reached the hall above the bank that night
he felt rather astonished to find that chairs and
stools had been arranged all over the spacious
hall, and that decorations consisting of the Stars
and Stripes and the Eagle Patrol flags were
strung everywhere. Off the main hall opened
the Scouts&rsquo; gymnasium and general store room.
In this room Rob found his Scouts assembled.
They greeted him with a cheer as he appeared.
Rob began to feel uneasy. He hated anything
like that, but he took the congratulations that
were showered upon him in the spirit in which
they were offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>When he found an opportunity he drew Merritt
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are all the chairs arranged outside
for?&rdquo; he asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just so that the folks can see what we&rsquo;ve
been doing with our time during the winter,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve arranged some single
stick bouts and an exhibition drill and so on&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a fine idea,&rdquo; declared Rob warmly.
&ldquo;How soon will the company&mdash;audience I mean&mdash;arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re beginning to come now,&rdquo; said
Merritt as the sound of feet tramping into the
hall became audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better send out Walter and Martin to act as
ushers, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so,&rdquo; and Merritt hastened off
to dispatch the two second class Scouts referred
to.</p>
<p>The hall filled rapidly. In the front rows Rob
could see his parents and beside them Commodore
Wingate, the scout master of the district,
and the parents of most of the boys. The other
chairs were filled with villagers and all at once&mdash;Rob&rsquo;s
heart beat rather quicker&mdash;down the aisle
came the Mainwaring party. They took the
three seats which had been apparently reserved
for them close to Rob&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Little Andy Bowles, who arrived late, came
into the gym in a state of high excitement.</p>
<p>Like most of the other scouts he had come
in by the back stairway which led directly into
the gym. He came straight up to Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he exclaimed, after he had given the
scout salute and congratulated his leader, &ldquo;say,
who do you think are hanging about outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; rejoined Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hodge Berry and Max Ramsay and
some of that bunch. They pretended not to
notice me, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re up to some mischief.
I could tell that by the way they sneaked
off when they saw me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what harm they can do us,&rdquo; rejoined
Rob, &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t doubt they&rsquo;d like
to work off some mean trick. Run along and put
on your best uniform, Andy, you&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone of note in Hampton was in the hall
by this time, and when Commodore Wingate
arose to make a preliminary address he was
warmly applauded. He dwelt at some length on
the new spirit that the Boy Scouts had brought
into Hampton, and explained that while some
misinformed persons appeared to think that the
scout movement was a warlike one, it was in
reality a great influence for peace. He reviewed
the work of the Eagles for the past year and
enumerated at some length the various services
they had done in the village. These included the
clearing up and beautifying of vacant lots, the
aiding of indigent or poor people, many little acts
of kindness and help, and the setting generally
of a good example to the youth of the town and
neighborhood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on to say, after an impressive
pause, &ldquo;it remained for the well-remembered
night of the Academy fire to bring into notice the
two most conspicuous acts of heroism the scouts
have yet performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if the annals of the Boy Scouts of
any country show two more noble, self-sacrificing
acts than those performed on that night by
Leader Rob Blake of the Eagles,&rdquo;&mdash;here such
loud applause broke out that the speaker was
compelled to pause for some minutes. When
quiet was restored he went on, &ldquo;and Merritt
Crawford, his able lieutenant.&rdquo; More applause.</p>
<p>While this was going on Rob was shaking his
fist at Merritt indignantly. Modest as most true
heroes, he had, of course, already quietly received
the thanks of the janitor&rsquo;s wife and the man himself
for his daring rescue and hoped that the
matter would end there. But this public acknowledgment
was too much for him. As for
Merritt, he was chuckling for a minute, but as
his own name was announced he turned a fiery
red and cried out in a voice that was audible to
the front rows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Commodore, I thought you were going to
leave me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This caused a great laugh among those who
heard it, and Rob felt revenged. But the worst
ordeal for the two boys still was ahead of them.
Above the din of applause that greeted the close
of Mr. Wingate&rsquo;s speech, they heard that gentleman
cry for silence. When quiet was restored
he turned around toward the gymnasium door
and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now ask Rob Blake and Merritt Crawford
to come forward and receive a slight token of
esteem from their fellow townsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried the Scouts behind Rob and
Merritt, under cover of a vigorous salvo of hand-clapping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>There was no use hanging back, and Rob and
Merritt, looking very ill at ease, stepped out
before the crowd. If the applause had been
loud before it was terrific then. The hall fairly
shook under it. Timid folks glanced upward at
the roof to make sure it was not going to be
blown off by enthusiasm. But at last, from sheer
weariness, even the most vigorous applauders
ceased. Then came a cry in a stentorian voice,
traced to the foreman of the Fire Vigilants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Rob Blake and Merritt
Crawford!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; came a tempest of cries
from all parts of the hall.</p>
<p>Commodore Wingate drew from his coat tail
pockets two velvet boxes. He opened them and
in each there lay, glittering on a bed of purple
plush, two miniature firemen&rsquo;s helmets of solid
gold set with diamonds. On the back of each
was inscribed: &ldquo;From a grateful community to
a Boy Scout hero.&rdquo; Then followed the date, the
name of the boy receiving the gift and the village
seal. Stepping forward the Scout Master pinned
to the breast of each lad the gleaming trophies
which would ever be among their proudest possessions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>In the fresh applause that followed there were
a few who did not join. These were Max Ramsay,
Hodge Berry and their cronies, all of whom
cordially disliked the Boy Scouts and hated to
see them the idols of the village. While the
applause was still sounding in lusty salvoes they
slipped out with mischievous looks on their faces.
Perhaps Andy Bowles&rsquo; guess that they were up
to some prank designed to work harm to the Boy
Scouts was not so far from the mark.</p>
<p>To relate in detail all that took place that evening
would occupy too much space. Suffice it to
say that the drills and exercises went off with
a snap, and that some of the games played proved
full of laughter and merriment. As the audience
filed out, more than one former lukewarm citizen
was heard to remark that the Boy Scout organization
was a &ldquo;mighty fine thing for lads, and
that the Eagles in particular not only shone
themselves, but reflected credit on their home
town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>But with the departure of the crowd, all was
not over. For some time, the boys&rsquo; gym buzzed
with chat and laughter. Naturally, Rob and
Merritt were the centers of attraction, and the
two gold, diamond-studded helmets were handed
about till it seemed that they must actually wear
out from constant handling! At last it was too
late to delay their departure for home any longer.
When the impromptu meeting did finally break
up, however, every fellow belonging to the Eagles
felt deep down in his heart that their organization,
despite criticism and even open enmity, had
proved its right to exist, and, what was more,
had even proved its necessity in raising ideals
and standards among the lads of the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll march out, fellows,&rdquo; declared Rob, &ldquo;and
as each chap&rsquo;s home or corner is reached he can
fall out of the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; was the cry, and then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in! Fall in!&rdquo; shouted Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lights out,&rdquo; was the next order and the
pushing of the electric light switch plunged the
place into darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo; and off they went, two by two, each
Scout marching as smartly as a trained veteran.</p>
<p>Outside, on the landing, it was very dark. The
blackness was made, so to speak, doubly black
by the fact that they had just been in a brilliantly
lighted room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the steps, boys! They&rsquo;re steep!&rdquo;
warned Rob, as his detachment of young Scouts
marched downward.</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken when the two lads
marching in front, Hiram and Paul, gave a
stumble and a yell. The next instant they rolled
down the steep stairway to the street. Before
they could take advantage of the warning, three
more pairs, including Merritt, had likewise executed
a bob forward and gone toppling down the
staircase to the sidewalk. They all landed in a
heap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out there! The steps have been soaped!&rdquo;
Rob had just time to call out and save the rest
from disaster.</p>
<p>The light from a street lamp gave a feeble
gleam on the struggling group below. The rest
of the boys, huddled for a moment above, by
exercising great care, managed to get over the
well-soaped and slippery steps without coming to
grief. One of them was Andy Bowles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just thought that Max Ramsay and Hodge
Berry and their bunch were up to some tricks
when I saw them round here, and I guess I was
right, too. How about it, Rob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think you were,&rdquo; responded
Bob. &ldquo;How are you, fellows? All right?&rdquo; he
asked as the downfallen Scouts picked themselves
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All present and accounted for,&rdquo; declared
Merritt, as they all stood up, vigorously brushing
dust and dirt from their trig uniforms, &ldquo;except
for a few bruises I guess we&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Hiram suddenly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>From somewhere near by, possibly from some
bushes that grew further down the street came
the sound of suppressed giggling and cat-calls.
There was no doubt as to what excited the merriment
of the unseen scoffers, nor was there, in
fact, any difficulty in guessing their identity.</p>
<p>Rob hardly knew whether to laugh or be angry.
Others of the Patrol had no such hesitancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Max Ramsay crowd,&rdquo; shouted Tubby
angrily. &ldquo;Come out here if you&rsquo;re not cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound of scuffling and retreating footsteps
followed this challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; shouted Hiram, &ldquo;the sneaks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s capture some of them and make them
pay dearly for those soapy stairs!&rdquo; shouted Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it, Rob?&rdquo; asked Merritt anxiously.</p>
<p>But Rob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;None of us are hurt,
and if they are mean enough to find satisfaction
in such tricks, let them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take it out of them for this skinned
ankle sooner or later,&rdquo; declared Tubby, hopping
about and nursing the injured member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; came from one or two of the
Scouts angrily. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get away with anything
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;ve just recollected,&rdquo; said Tubby
suddenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some rule or other that says
Scouts mustn&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob was instantly appealed to by half a dozen
anxious voices owned by the victims of the soapy
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course no Scout is supposed
to engage in fisticuffs except in actual self-defense;
but&mdash;well I guess there&rsquo;s a limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s been reached,&rdquo; muttered Tubby vindictively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I just fell down,&rdquo; grunted Tubby.</p>
<p>And then, without more discussion of the mean
trick that had been played them, the Scouts
marched off. After that glorious evening they
all felt that they could well afford to ignore such
contemptible pranks as those of Max Ramsay
and his crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p class="tb">As for Rob and Merritt, proud as they felt
of the honor that had been paid them that night,
they somehow could not help valuing even more
highly the quiet thanks that had come to them
from full hearts before the public demonstration
had been thought of. It is a Scout&rsquo;s duty to do
his work without hope of reward, save that
which comes from a sense of work well done,
which, after all, is the best reward and the most
enduring that any boy, or man, either, for that
matter, can have.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">A NOVEL PROPOSAL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of my proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he regarded
the three lads seated opposite him in
the library of his home which he had called Ancon
Hill, possibly in remembrance of that other Ancon
Hill in the far off Canal Zone.</p>
<p>Tubby gulped; Merritt&rsquo;s eyes shone and his
face flushed excitedly, but he couldn&rsquo;t find words
just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Rob, what do <i>you</i> say to transplanting
the Boy Scouts, or part of them, down along the
big Ditch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;that is, we&mdash;it&rsquo;s too big&mdash;too glorious
to just realize it all at once, isn&rsquo;t it, fellows?&rdquo;
stammered Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I thought the motto of your clan
was &lsquo;Be Prepared&rsquo;. Now you ought to be just
as much prepared to accept my invitation to go
to Panama as you would be to cook a meal in a
given time or light a fire with one match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring regarded the young faces opposite
him with a quizzical look. Then he spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just what you fellows are thinking,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to go, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s our folks, you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tubby
managed to sputter. The others nodded solemnly.
This proposal of Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s, that while
the Academy was closed they should go as his
guests to the Canal Zone and see the wonders of
that region, both natural and man-made, had
fairly taken them off their feet, as the saying is.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to that part of it later,&rdquo; responded
Mr. Mainwaring. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; he
added with a twinkle in his eyes, &ldquo;if it could all
be arranged satisfactorily. You see, I&rsquo;m not
going to take you lads down there to idle. Far
from it. Idleness is the worst thing for boys
or men. I&rsquo;ve work for you to do. As I told
you, this young scamp Jared, who is really more
fool than knave, has skipped out for the Isthmus.
That I have found out as you know. With him
went Alverado and Estrada, the latter having
suddenly resigned his diplomatic post at Washington.
A third party went also, who I more
than suspect is the keen-faced young man you
told me you had seen in Jared&rsquo;s company at the
barn, at the ball game, and also on the evening
Jared took his abrupt departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, of course, they are on the <i>qui vive</i> on
the Isthmus for this precious outfit who, undoubtedly,
mean mischief of some sort. Just
what it is I am not prepared to say, but I can
tell you that I have a shrewd suspicion. Now
you boys have plenty of pluck, resource and enterprise&mdash;don&rsquo;t
turn red, I&rsquo;m not in the habit of
flattering anybody and I mean it. You are the
only people that I know of that have actually
seen Alverado and who would be able to pick
out this miserable, misled Jared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want us to do detective work!&rdquo; gasped
Tubby in an awe-struck tone.</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring laughed and threw up his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven save the mark! I suspect you of
reading dime novels, Master Tubby. No, there
is nothing Old-Sleuth-like about what I would
want you to do; nothing very thrilling or exciting
about it. I&rsquo;d simply want you to accompany me
and maybe point out the men you have seen
plotting together, for the benefit of the Isthmian
police; so you see there is no danger, no glamour,
no promise of adventure about it; only a hum-drum
trip, but one that I am sure will prove
full of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Mr. Mainwaring possessed a prophetic
eye he might not have spoken exactly as recorded
above. But not being blessed with such an organ
he, of course, had no means of knowing into
what danger and adventure the Boy Scouts were
destined to be thrust while on the Isthmus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we&rsquo;d like to go!&rdquo; sighed Rob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a beautiful dream,&rdquo; struck in Merritt
with a far-away look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that there&rsquo;s plenty to eat down that
way?&rdquo; asked Tubby rather suspiciously.</p>
<p>The tension was relieved by a hearty laugh
from them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only asked, you know,&rdquo; remarked
Tubby in an injured tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that that&rsquo;s all explained,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mainwaring, after the merriment had subsided,
&ldquo;I may as well tell you that all your parents
know of my wish and are quite willing that you
should go, in spite of the fact that for some weeks
they will be deprived of your interesting society.
And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all discipline was at an end for the nonce.
The boys&rsquo; spirits fairly broke bounds. They
leaped up, joined hands and danced round in a
circle. It was like some impossible, glorious
dream coming true; for each of them had long
cherished a desire to see Uncle Sam&rsquo;s wonderful
digging operations which, under the Stars and
Stripes, were to join two mighty oceans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>In the midst of the excitement the door opened
and in came Fred Mainwaring; but Lucy was
not with him, rather to the disappointment of one
of the Scouts. Fred, after the boys had all
shaken hands warmly and indulged in another
war dance, announced that his sister had had to
leave suddenly for the West the night before,
as her mother, who was stopping with relatives
there, had absolutely forbidden the project of
taking her along.</p>
<p>It was not till after they had taken their leave
and were walking with Fred down the drive leading
to the road back to Hampton that Lucy&rsquo;s
brother seized an opportunity to draw Rob aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking so glum about?&rdquo; he
demanded with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Me?&rdquo; rejoined Rob indignantly, &ldquo;I
never felt better in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>But his looks belied him. And, strange to say,
Rob&rsquo;s gloom dated from the moment that Fred
had announced Lucy&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, old fellow,&rdquo; laughed Fred merrily, &ldquo;if
you don&rsquo;t remind me of the ostrich in the fable!
Here,&mdash;here&rsquo;s her address,&mdash;take it and be happy.
Bless you, my children,&rdquo; and without waiting for
an answer, Fred thrust a bit of paper into Rob&rsquo;s
hand and darted off with a merry:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you to-morrow. We&rsquo;ll have lots to talk
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob rejoined his companions, who had walked
on some distance ahead. His gloomy look had
vanished like snow in the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great, glittering, glorious?&rdquo; cried
Merritt as he came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t believe it yet,&rdquo; cried Tubby.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll wake up like I do some nights
when I&rsquo;m dreaming about a banquet at which
I&rsquo;m an honored guest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and I can always send postcards from
the Isthmus,&rdquo; breathed Rob, which remark did
not seem very germane to the conversation. His
companions looked at him in amazement for an
instant and then, comprehending, broke into a
roar of laughter, for which Rob chased them half
way back to Hampton, catching Tubby at last
and belaboring that stout youth till he roared for
mercy.</p>
<p>But the fat boy had his revenge. As soon as
he was released he sought a safe refuge and
then, holding his staff like a guitar, he rolled
his eyes upward in imitation of a troubadour, and
howled at the top of his voice:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;On a bee-yoot-i-ful night!</p>
<p class="t0">With a bee-yoot-i-ful gy-url!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Rob didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or be angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">OFF FOR THE ISTHMUS.</span></h2>
<p>The <i>S.S. Caribbean</i> lay at her dock at the foot
of West Twenty-fifth Street, New York City,
with steam up in readiness for her departure for
Colon, which, as every boy knows, is the easterly
port of the Canal Zone and the terminus on that
side of the Isthmus of the Panama Railroad.
Everything appeared to be a perfect maze of confusion.
Derricks rattled, steam winches roared
and wagons clattered about the dock in every
direction. From the &rsquo;scape pipe of the big
steamer white wisps of steam were pouring,
while black smoke rolled from the squat, black
funnel. At the foremast flew the Blue Peter,
that blue flag with a square white center that, all
the world over, signifies &ldquo;Sailing day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Down Twenty-fourth Street, hurrying with all
their might, came three boys whom, even had
they not worn their Scout uniforms, we should
have had no difficulty in recognizing as Rob, Merritt
and Tubby. All were laden down with packages,&mdash;things
bought at the last moment. The
main part of their equipment was already on
board. As we know, their numerous camping
expeditions had provided for them so amply in
that way that it had hardly been necessary to
buy anything in that line. Tents, cooking outfits,
and so on, they had long possessed.</p>
<p>But on board the ship, in the stateroom they
were all three to share, reposed their proudest
possessions: three blue-steel automatic revolvers
with their cartridge belts, etc., and three brand
new automatic rifles of heavy caliber. The latter
had been the gift of Mr. Mainwaring, while
the revolvers the boys had bought themselves on
his recommendation. It was quite likely, it
appeared, that they would explore some of the
upper reaches of the Chagres River, a region
infested by big snakes, jaguars and alligators,
and weapons were more or less of a necessity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Good-byes had been said early that morning
when an admiring, if slightly envious, cohort of
Scouts, with the village band at their heads, had
escorted them to the train for New York. It
had been a period of glorious excitement up to
that time, but when the moment came to say the
last good-byes and they had waved and given the
Scout cry for the last time, the three lads felt
strangely sober. This supernatural depression
of spirits had endured till they reached New
York, where their last shopping excursion for
some time diverted their thoughts and drove
away the blues. So that it was a laughing, merrily
chatting trio that came at a brisk walk down
Twenty-fourth Street on its way to meet Mr.
Mainwaring and Fred at the steamer. All felt
that their departure for the tropics meant a new
epoch in their lives. As for their friends at
home, the Hampton local paper had devoted a
column to the lads&rsquo; departure, calling them
&ldquo;Hampton&rsquo;s Boy Scout Pioneers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>How much they wished that they could have
brought all the Eagles with them to share their
anticipated experiences! But that was manifestly
impossible, and so, as the next best thing,
Tubby carried a camera and an ample supply of
films with which to make all the pictures he could
to be shown to admiring audiences on their
return.</p>
<p>The water front opposite the sailing place of
the West India and South American ships is a
busy spot. Life boils over thereabouts and the
boys felt quite bewildered as they faced the broad
street packed with rumbling wagons and swearing
drivers and stevedores that lay between them
and the dock bearing in big white letters the
magic words: Panama Steamship Company.</p>
<p>They were just about to cross the street when
their attention was suddenly distracted by the
sound of some sort of scuffle or argument going
on near at hand. Facing about they were not
long in discovering what the trouble was. Drawn
up against the curb was a small peddler&rsquo;s hand-cart,
covered with rosy apples piled high in tempting
fashion. Behind it stood a kindly-looking
old woman who just at that moment appeared to
be very much flustered and excited. The cause
was soon apparent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Above the quavering voice of the old woman
came a loud, blustering one that the boys were
swift to recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Ramsay! What in the world is he doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hodge Berry is with him and two other
boys that look like city fellows,&rdquo; struck in Merritt.
&ldquo;What are they up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain enough that they are plaguing that
poor old woman,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, &ldquo;and it
wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they had come down here
to see us off on the steamer and try to make
trouble of some kind. I heard they were staying
with Ramsay&rsquo;s cousins in the city till the school
was rebuilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a shame, anyhow,&rdquo; cried Merritt
indignantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>He had just seen what the Hampton worthies
and their friends were up to. They had amused
themselves by plaguing the old woman till she
was half beside herself, and then, while she was
berating one of them, the others would steal
some apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s downright thievery,&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is. Just what I&rsquo;d expect
from such cads,&rdquo; cried Merritt, fully as angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look like good apples, too,&rdquo; commented
Tubby, regarding the fruit with the eye of an
expert in such matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you aren&rsquo;t the limit,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt,
giving him a disgusted look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I got a right to give my opinion?&rdquo;
asked the fat Scout demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the mean skunks,&rdquo; cried Rob indignantly,
with a darkening brow. &ldquo;See, the
poor old woman is lame. She&rsquo;s got a crutch there.
She can&rsquo;t get after them and that&rsquo;s why they are
so bold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, and stop it,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt
impulsively, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand for anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get a policeman,&rdquo; suggested Tubby
prudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see one in sight,&rdquo; rejoined Rob; &ldquo;I
guess it&rsquo;s up to us to stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I get even for that tumble I
took, Scout rules or no Scout rules,&rdquo; muttered
Tubby to himself as the three lads advanced.</p>
<p>Max Ramsay was contentedly munching a big
red apple as they approached. He was too much,
engrossed with laughing at the anger of the old
woman and the mean pranks of his friends to notice
the trio of determined looking lads nearing
him. He had already swooped down on the stand
and was now trying to divert the old woman&rsquo;s
attention from the raids of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that apple, Max Ramsay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the first warning that Max had that
the three Scouts from Hampton were on the
scene. He and his companions had, as Rob
guessed, come down to the steamer to make
trouble for the boys if they could. But on the
way they had stopped to divert themselves at
the old apple woman&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Max turned a trifle pale for an instant, but
then he bethought himself of his companions
and grew defiant again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d drop it for you,&rdquo; he said sneeringly.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s arm flashed out and seized Max&rsquo;s wrist.
The next instant the apple was flying across the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; grunted Max, &ldquo;what are you trying
to do? Break my arm? Hey, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions, their attention thus drawn,
rallied to Max&rsquo;s support. But Rob, crimson with
just anger, never noticed them. Nothing made
the young Scout leader more angry than cruelty
or injustice to children, the old and feeble, or
dumb animals. His eyes fairly blazed now as he
faced Max, who looked mean and cringing
beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now get out of this, you coward,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
grabbing Max&rsquo;s shoulder and giving
that worthy a good shove. &ldquo;Be off and take your
friends with you. You ought to be ashamed of
yourselves, treating a poor old woman this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em a good punching,&rdquo; muttered
Tubby belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; chimed in Merritt; but
Rob held back his two fire-eating chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not scared of the whole bunch of
you namby-pamby sissies,&rdquo; cried Hodge Berry,
a hulking lad who, however, took good care to
keep out of reach of Rob&rsquo;s fists. He had once witnessed
what they could do and had no desire for
a personal experience. Now Max&rsquo;s two city
cousins chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give those toy soldiers a good
hiding?&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; those Boy Scouts are too dern busy,&rdquo;
put in the other, a pale-faced, pimply lad of about
seventeen.</p>
<p>But despite these brave remarks, neither of
them made any effort to back up Max or Hodge
Berry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right for you. We&rsquo;ll fix you some time,&rdquo;
snarled Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not do it now?&rdquo; inquired Tubby.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re four to three, that&rsquo;s good odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we could lick you if we wanted to. We&rsquo;ll
do it, too, when you get back from Panama, if
you ever do. I hope the &rsquo;gators eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Rob, laughing in spite of
himself; &ldquo;and as for fighting you fellows, why
I don&rsquo;t much believe in it, but if you don&rsquo;t make
yourselves scarce, I&rsquo;ll give you rowdies a lesson
you won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah-h-h-h-h!&rdquo; was all that the apple raiders
could think of to say, but they faded away from
the scene in as dignified a manner as they could
muster.</p>
<p>The three Scouts then bought some apples
from the old woman, who poured out her thanks
so profusely that a small crowd began to gather
about her and listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get out of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>They hurried away, followed by the old
woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wurra wurras,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God bless yez
fer foine byes now, even if ye do wear haythenish
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were out of earshot, Rob turned
his attention to his badge, which he was wearing
upside down. Like many other Scouts, he didn&rsquo;t
turn it the right way up till he had lived up to
the Scout rules of doing a daily kind deed. He
now turned his badge the right way and so
did his chums, who had adopted this rule also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have felt better if I could have got a good
crack at those chaps, though,&rdquo; said Tubby
between bites at his apple.</p>
<p>Suddenly a steamer&rsquo;s whistle boomed out above
the dock-side uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz, fellows, that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;all ashore&rsquo;
whistle. We&rsquo;ve got to hustle!&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>The three Scouts broke into a run, each congratulating
himself that he could present himself
before Mr. Mainwaring with an &ldquo;upturned
badge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">SOMETHING ABOUT THE CANAL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell us what you know about
Panama and the canal?&rdquo; remarked Tubby to Rob
as the three boys perched in the bow of the
<i>Caribbean</i>, three days out, watching the flying fish
as the vessel&rsquo;s prow sent them scattering like
coveys of birds from big patches of yellow gulf
weed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; supplemented Merritt,
&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t get much time to study
books down there. Mr. Mainwaring said this
morning that, after he had given the work a
preliminary look-over, he was going to hunt for
the source of that tributary of the Chagres that
he thinks is responsible for the big floods every
rainy season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose I know much more
about it than you two fellows do,&rdquo; rejoined Rob
modestly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been reading up on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he looked at Tubby, who had done nothing
much on the steamer but consume three huge
meals a day, with &ldquo;snacks&rdquo; in between, and
amuse himself. One of these amusements had
been stuffing some of those odd-looking pills
known as &ldquo;Pharaoh&rsquo;s Serpents&rdquo; into the captain&rsquo;s
pipe. Almost every boy can guess what happened
when the glowing tobacco reached the &ldquo;Serpents&rdquo;
and big, wriggly, writhing things began
to climb out of the pipe bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach himmel, der sea serpent,&rdquo; yelled the
skipper, who was a German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-h-h!&rdquo; screamed a lot of ladies to
whom he happened to be talking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>It was just at this juncture that the captain
had caught sight of Tubby doubled up with
laughter behind a ventilator. He chased and
captured the fat youth, who then and there received
a spanking for which he got no sympathy,
even from his fellow Scouts. Except for spilling
&ldquo;sneezing powder&rdquo; in the main dining room at
dinner time and burning an old gentleman&rsquo;s bald
head by sun rays concentrated in a magnifying
glass, Tubby had done nothing out of the way
since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away. Unload your knowledge,&rdquo; ordered
Merritt, luxuriously stretching out under the
awning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here goes. To begin at the beginning,
of course you know that Panama was discovered
by Christopher Columbus in 1502.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger snaps!&rdquo; interrupted Tubby. &ldquo;Is there
anything, except Coney Island, that he didn&rsquo;t
discover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; cried Merritt indignantly.
&ldquo;Go on, Rob, it&rsquo;s just the nature of the beast.
Never mind him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Rob, &ldquo;Columbus discovered
the Chagres River and sailed up it. He called
the beautiful harbor by which he entered it Porto
Bello. Then came Balboa, who was the first to
cross the Isthmus and view the Pacific. It was
about this time that a road was built across and
the city of Panama founded on the Pacific side.
It was from Panama that Pizarro set out to begin
his brutal campaign which ended in the practical
extinction of the Incas of Peru.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut out the history and let&rsquo;s get down to
the canal,&rdquo; muttered Tubby; &ldquo;I hate history,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief that you like nothing but eating,&rdquo;
declared Merritt indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sleeping,&rdquo; put in Tubby without a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road was fifty miles long and well paved
and provided with substantial bridges, some of
which are yet standing although the road is
almost impassable,&rdquo; went on Rob. &ldquo;It was the
war between Mexico and Uncle Sam in 1846-47
that brought about a change. But in the meantime,
I forgot to tell you that old Panama was
sacked by Captain Henry Morgan and his pirates
in 1671, great stores of gold taken and the
inhabitants put to the torture. The city was
never rebuilt, but its ruins still stand some miles
from the site of the present city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what happened in the Mexican war?&rdquo;
asked Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. At that time there were
not more than 9,000 miles of railroad in America,
and it was a hard matter to get as far west as
Chicago by rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the East and the Pacific Coast lay
great prairies, practically unexplored. Indians
were thickly scattered over this region and very
hostile to the white man. The journey across
took months. The lack of a short route to the
Pacific coast set everybody to thinking. Then,
in 1849, came the great gold rush to California.
Hundreds of miners went by way of the Isthmus,
but there was no railroad and they got sick, and
many of them died on the way across. It became
clear that there must be a railroad and, at last,
in 1855, after unheard of difficulties had been
mastered, one was completed with American
capital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;From the first it paid tremendously, in the
space of forty-seven years making $38,000,000
of clear profit for its projectors. But to build
that forty-eight miles of track had cost 2,000
recorded human lives, five years of labor, and
$8,000,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First history, then a railroad year book, and
now, I suppose, we&rsquo;ll get down to the canal,&rdquo;
grunted Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s coming now,&rdquo; smiled Rob. &ldquo;In
the first place, the idea of building a canal across
the narrow strip of land forming the Isthmus
had been a dream even of the early Spaniards.
Then a Scotchman founded a colony which was
to grow rich on the products of the Isthmus and
also dig a canal. Disease and failure soon put
an end to this enterprise. In fact, from the
earliest days Panama and the Isthmus have
always been known as one of the most unhealthy
spots on earth. As you may know, it is only nine
degrees north of the equator, and the rainy season
lasts more than half the year. But nowadays,
with modern medicine and modern hygienic
methods, it is quite safe, with reasonable care,
to penetrate the jungle. Mr. Mainwaring told
me that,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after various schemes had been gotten
up and had fallen through, a French company,
backed by the money of almost everyone in
France who could by hook or crook secure stock,
in 1882 turned the first shovelful of earth for a
canal. It was to have been a sea-level one, that
is, one without locks, and was projected and engineered
by Ferdinand De Lesseps, the aged
builder of the Suez canal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know now that a sea-level canal would
not be feasible on the Isthmus. It would take too
long to build and cost a prohibitive sum, almost
double what a lock canal costs. For seven years
digging went on, with fearful loss of life among
the laborers and engineers from yellow fever.
Then, in 1899, it was discovered that almost half
of the $400,000,000 raised had been squandered
in mismanagement and waste, and by far the
larger part had gone in what we should nowadays
call &lsquo;graft&rsquo;. An investigation was made.
Several of the promoters of the canal committed
suicide, and De Lesseps went mad and died in
an asylum. Such was the tragic history of the
French era; but brighter days were to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in 1898 when the <i>Oregon</i> made her
record run from San Francisco to join the Atlantic
fleet in the West Indies and fight the
Spaniards off Cuba, that Americans began to
think that a short cut was needed. With our
acquisition of the Philippines, a &lsquo;door&rsquo; between
the Pacific and Atlantic was declared to be almost
a necessity. There was much discussion at Washington,
but finally in 1903 President Roosevelt
and Congress decided that if we could purchase
from the French all they had left at Panama and
could, in addition, buy a strip or &lsquo;zone&rsquo; across
the Isthmus for canal building purposes, it would
be fitting and right for the United States to take
up the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After some dickering, the French company,
took $40,000,000 for what they owned, and, in
1904, the Panama Republic, a newly created nation,
sold the United States for $10,000,000 a
strip of land ten miles wide and fifty miles long,
which strip of land is now known as the Canal
Zone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing that the Americans did after
they took hold was to start a campaign against
disease. No canal could be dug while yellow
fever had to be reckoned with. Under the masterly
hand of Col. W. C. Gorgas, the Zone has
been cleaned up till disease is almost rarer than
in cities of the north. Mosquitoes have been
wiped out, streets paved, filth and garbage, which
used to lie and rot under the hot sun, all swept
away, and good comfortable houses put up for
workmen and their bosses. The men who stand
the climate best among the laborers are Jamaican
negroes. Hindus, Italians and Spaniards are also
employed for lighter work, but for &lsquo;making the
dirt fly&rsquo; the Sambo is the real thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else you&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Merritt. &ldquo;Just why is this
Chagres River such an important part of the
canal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way, as I understand it,&rdquo; said
Rob. &ldquo;In the first place, the canal is fifty miles
long,&mdash;forty-one miles through the land and nine
miles of channel dredged out in the harbors of
Colon and Panama. From Colon to Bah Bohia
the route passes for twelve miles through low,
swampy ground not much above sea level. Then
it cuts into the hills and is practically a more or
less shallow ditch as far as a place called Miraflores,
nine miles away. The highest point of
land that the canal must traverse is Gold Hill, at
the famous Culebra, where it is 662 feet above
the sea level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But right here occurs a &lsquo;saddle&rsquo; through
which the canal must run. This, at its lowest
point, is 312 feet above sea level. Right here is
the notorious Culebra Cut, which is an immense
excavation nine miles long and, in places, more
than three hundred feet deep in solid rock,&mdash;think
of that!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad as Culebra has been as an obstacle, however,
the Chagres River is worse. For 23 miles
the canal must follow the valley of this river and
cross and recross its bed. The Chagres is an
unruly stream. At times it is small, and then
again it swells to tremendous size, sweeping all
before it and causing great floods. To build the
canal the problem was to turn the Chagres into
a friend, instead of an enemy, and that, it is
believed, has been done in an unique way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must now roughly picture a cross section
of the canal route as a flat-topped pyramid.
Suppose the top of the pyramid to be hollow and
that through that hollow flows the Chagres
River. Well, on one side of your cup or hollow
is the famous Gatun Dam, in the construction of
which 2,250,000 barrels of cement have been
used. Below the Gatun Dam is a &lsquo;flight,&rsquo; just
like a succession of steps of locks. These will be
used to lower vessels from the &lsquo;cup&rsquo; at the top
to the Atlantic level,&mdash;or to raise them, as the
case may be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the other end of the cup, on the Pacific
end that is, will be another flight of locks, the
Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks, which will
raise or lower vessels from and to the Pacific.
Is that clear? There&rsquo;s a big cup at the top of
our pyramid, and steps, or &lsquo;locks,&rsquo; lead down
to the levels of the oceans on each side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s as clear as mud,&rdquo; muttered Tubby,
&ldquo;go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, we get to the Chagres and the
part it plays,&rdquo; went on Rob serenely. &ldquo;That
whole &lsquo;cup&rsquo; at the top of our pyramid is actually
an artificial lake of vast size. As a matter of
fact, it will be 165 square miles in area. At
Gatun a great dam will hold it in, and at Pedro
Miguel the locks will perform the same office.
This lake is the valley of Chagres, and the
Chagres will be relied on to keep it filled. This
immense Gatun Lake, as it is called, is the &lsquo;keystone&rsquo;
of the canal. Any weakness in the Gatun
Dam would ruin the whole project. You can see,
of course, why this is so, because the water in
that Gatun Lake will be relied upon to fill the
locks which will raise vessels up or down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the Chagres River cuts up ugly,
as you said it does sometimes?&rdquo; asked Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;I heard Mr. Mainwaring
say that the great lake will be so big that a flood
would affect its level no more than a cup of water
poured into a bath tub. The river will merely
serve to keep the lake filled and supply the water
needed to work the locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good description, Master Rob,&rdquo;
said a voice at their elbows.</p>
<p>They started and looked up, and there was Mr.
Mainwaring himself looking down at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have changed the Chagres from a dangerous
enemy into an excellent friend,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but, as Rob pointed out, the Gatun is unavoidably
the spot at which an enemy who wished to
harm us could do almost irretrievable damage
at the expenditure of a few dollars&rsquo; worth of
dynamite, if,&rdquo; he paused for an instant, &ldquo;if he
knew just where to place it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone possess such knowledge?&rdquo; asked
Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, anyone possessing a duplicate of my
plans would know just how to set about dealing
the canal a fearful blow,&rdquo; was the slow response.</p>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s pulses beat fast and thick. He caught
his breath. Jared had such duplicate plans, and
was in the hands of men who could work on his
weak nature to give them up. He glanced up at
Mr. Mainwaring, expecting to see signs of
anxiety on his face. But the engineer was perfectly
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all that &lsquo;dry history,&rsquo; as Tubby called
it,&rdquo; said he, with a smile, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and play
shuffle board. Fred is waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">AT OLD PANAMA.</span></h2>
<p>The week following the conversation recorded
in the last chapter found the travelers located at
the Hotel Grand Central, in Panama City.
Colon, although the Americans have done much
to clean it up and make it more presentable than
in former days, does not hold much of interest.
Besides, Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s offices were at
Panama, which made his presence there a necessity.</p>
<p>The boys had passed a busy time sight-seeing
in the old city. They had climbed the Cathedral
towers, gazing out over the glittering bay dotted
with small but beautiful islands, where the
wealthy Panamans spent the heated months.
They had explored nooks and corners and inspected
the oldest church on the continent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>On the particular day on which this chapter
opens they had planned an expedition to Old
Panama city, which lies about five miles from
the present town. Mr. Mainwaring was busy,
but Fred had obtained leave to accompany the
boys, his duties as his father&rsquo;s secretary not being
very onerous. They set out in high spirits
along the road leading to the ruins of the golden
city sacked by Morgan and his buccaneers.</p>
<p>The drive was made in an aged hack, and
hardly had the boys left the outskirts of the town
before they were exclaiming over the luxuriant
tropical vegetation and the odd sights that met
their eyes on every side. Once or twice they
crossed small streams, and laughed at the sight
of native women pounding clothes on rocks at
the water side with big, flat clubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help the buttons!&rdquo; cried Merritt.
&ldquo;This must be a paradise for button manufacturers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they don&rsquo;t bother much with them, at
least not the natives that we&rsquo;ve passed,&rdquo; chuckled
Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look at that bunch of bananas!&rdquo; cried
Tubby presently, as they passed by a clump of
green banana plants laden with fruit. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
hop out and get some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the fruit was green and uneatable.
Bananas, as Tubby did not know, are picked and
shipped while green, and grow yellow and ripe
on the voyage north in the holds of the fruit
steamers, which are kept carefully at a uniform
temperature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd that we&rsquo;ve seen nothing of Jared or
his friends,&rdquo; remarked Rob, as, after the discovery
of Tubby&rsquo;s mistake, they drove on again.
&ldquo;Has your dad notified the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; rejoined Fred Mainwaring,
&ldquo;but nothing has come of it as yet. Of course,
a careful lookout is being kept. Say, fellows,&rdquo;
he exclaimed in a cautious tone, &ldquo;do you know
I believe that some plot is on foot to injure the
great Gatun Dam and delay the opening of the
canal? At least, I&rsquo;m pretty sure, from things I&rsquo;ve
heard dad say, that such is the case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you think, or rather he thinks, that Jared
is mixed up in it?&rdquo; asked Tubby breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what. At least he is mixed up in it
to this extent, that he is supplying the plotters
with plans of the dam and so on in order that
they can strike their blow at the weakest part
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! I&rsquo;d like to get my hands on that
Jared just once,&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt angrily.
&ldquo;What a skunk he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we ever let him get away from
Hampton,&rdquo; muttered Merritt. &ldquo;Of course, we
found out that he and the man with him bought
tickets for New York, but that was only a blind
clew at best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t actually know that he is on
the Zone at all,&rdquo; struck in Rob; &ldquo;although all the
steamship offices were quizzed, we couldn&rsquo;t find
out that anybody answering Jared&rsquo;s description
had taken passage for the Isthmus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So far as that is concerned,&rdquo; remarked Fred,
&ldquo;dad says that that proves nothing. He might
have shipped from San Francisco or New
Orleans, or even from some Canadian port for
some other destination, and then worked his way
up here on a sailing vessel or coasting steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just about what he would have
done,&rdquo; cried Rob. &ldquo;Both Alverado and Estrada
have plenty of sympathizers in Bogota who
would help them in any plot against Uncle Sam.
But, after all, the whole thing may be a false
alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so if you could have
heard what dad said at that meeting of the
Canal heads the other day,&rdquo; rejoined Fred. &ldquo;Of
course I can&rsquo;t tell you what took place, although
I was present in my capacity as secretary; but
from what I heard a strict watch is to be kept
and the guards doubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Estrada and Alverado know the country
well, it&rsquo;s quite likely that they aren&rsquo;t in the city
at all,&rdquo; struck in Merritt. &ldquo;The country outside
the actual Canal Zone is a trackless jungle.
They may be hiding up in there some place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite likely, too,&rdquo; rejoined Fred. &ldquo;I
heard dad saying something about that the other
day. By the way, we are going to start up the
Chagres day after to-morrow; won&rsquo;t that be
bully? That&rsquo;s my idea of sport,&mdash;following up
a tropic river looking for a tributary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your dad going to do with the tributary
when he finds it?&rdquo; asked the practical Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been settled yet,&rdquo; was the
rejoinder. &ldquo;Of course, if it proves to be the
branch that feeds the Chagres and causes all the
trouble in flood time, it will be dammed or something
so as to make it harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t talk so loud,&rdquo; whispered Rob in a
cautious tone, for the boys from their first low
tones had gradually drifted into louder talk,
&ldquo;that driver is listening to every word we&rsquo;re
saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like an inquisitive nigger,&rdquo; growled Fred
resentfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a nigger,&rdquo; declared Rob; &ldquo;he looks
to me more like a Latin-American of some sort.
He may be a fellow countryman of this Estrada.
In that case, I hope he didn&rsquo;t overhear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were talking as loud as any of us,&rdquo;
declared Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. I kind of wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Merritt suddenly.</p>
<p>He had good reason to exclaim. Ahead of
them, rising majestically above the brilliant-hued
tropical greenery, was a vast gray tower, square
and massive, and pierced with square windows.
At its summit it was overgrown with mosses,
lichens and many-hued flowers of gorgeous coloring.
But for this, it might have seemed anything
but a ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruined tower of the old cathedral church
of St. Augustin!&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all that remains of the city from
which Morgan took so much plunder that it
required seventy-five mules and six hundred
prisoners to pack it across the Isthmus to Porto
Bello,&rdquo; chimed in Merritt, who, it will be seen
from this remark, had been reading up on
Panama.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Leaving the rig behind them, the four lads
made their way to the foot of the tower. They
elected to push their way through a tangle of
brush instead of following the regular footpath.
As Tubby said, it seemed more like coming to a
ruin than by strolling up to it on a beaten track.
Their tough khaki uniforms resisted the thorns
and brambles valiantly, and they arrived at the
foot of the massive old tower out of breath but
undamaged, except for sundry scratches on their
hands.</p>
<p>They entered the old tower through a tumble-down
doorway. The walls, they noticed as they
passed through, were three feet or more thick,
which perhaps accounted for the sturdy piles
standing so long after the rest of the city had
vanished. Inside was a crumbled stairway of
stone up which the four Scouts were soon scrambling.
They clambered to the very top and then
Rob and Fred drew from their pockets two pennants.
One bore the &ldquo;totem&rdquo; of the Eagles; the
other was emblazoned with the Patrol emblem of
the Black Wolves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of this just before we left,&rdquo; said
Rob, as he drew out the Eagle flag; &ldquo;I guess
we&rsquo;re the first Boy Scouts on the Isthmus and
so we&rsquo;ll be the first to unfurl our totems above
old Panama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are you going to make the flag
fast?&rdquo; asked Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that prickly branch growing right out
from the edge of the tower? I guess I&rsquo;ll make
mine fast to that,&rdquo; said Rob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be as good as
a flag pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out you don&rsquo;t slip,&rdquo; warned Merritt, as
Rob made his way over roughly piled stones that
had crumbled from the parapet and gained the
edge of the tower. At that point a staff-like
thorn bush raised one bare arm aloft. As Rob
had said, it did indeed make a regular flag pole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Balancing himself carefully, the leader of the
Eagle Patrol reached out and peered over the
edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, fellows, but it looks a long way to
the ground!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If I ever fell, I&rsquo;d
land with a bump all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clasping the flag in one hand, he leaned out
and laid hold of the upright branch. There was
a sudden cracking sound. The horrified Scouts,
who were watching Rob, saw him make a desperate
grab at the wall to recover himself as the
branch snapped.</p>
<p>But Rob&rsquo;s effort came too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; yelled Tubby, turning as white
as a ghost as Rob, without a sound, plunged over
the parapet and out of sight.</p>
<p>His chums turned sick and faint. They dared
not go to the edge to gaze upon what they knew
must lie at the foot of the tower. They simply
stood like figures carved out of wood waiting for
the sound of Rob&rsquo;s crashing fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">BETWEEN EARTH AND SKY.</span></h2>
<p>But no such sound came. Instead they heard
something that brought them instantly to the
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, fellows! Come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Rob&rsquo;s voice, coming up to them over the
edge of that dizzy height.</p>
<p>In three bounds, careless of the consequences
of a false step, they were on the parapet of the
tower where they had last seen Rob, as he
reached out for the treacherous &ldquo;flag pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, boys! Look! There he is! Hold on,
Rob, old fellow. Hold on, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
cried Merritt.</p>
<p>Rob, his feet dug into the rough interstices of
the old ruinous wall, was clinging to a stoutly
rooted bush that had broken his fall and given
him one second in which to stay his awful plunge
into space. But his position even now was bad
enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>His face was as white as chalk, and the sweat
streamed down it in rivers as he gazed up at his
comrades above. He was fully thirty feet below
them, and they had no rope, no means of saving
him from his fearful position! In the very
nature of things his muscles, strong as they were,
were bound to give out before long. It was not
in flesh and blood to endure such a tension long;
and then&mdash;&mdash; But they dared not think of that.</p>
<p>It was a moment for quick action and nimble
wits. The shrub to which Rob was clinging
appeared to be firmly rooted. In fact, it must
have been, to have withstood the strain of his
crashing fall. Then, too, his toes were driven
home into a crack of the wall, relieving to some
extent the weight brought to bear on the shrub.
But this could not last indefinitely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Suddenly Merritt noticed something. Just
above the place where Rob clung to the wall, a
hundred feet above the waving banana fronds,
was an opening. As he saw this a sudden idea
struck him. He thought he saw a way, a desperate
way, it is true, but still a way to rescue
Rob from his perilous position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long can you hold on, Rob?&rdquo; he called
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much longer I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; came back in
a voice that could hardly have been recognized
as Rob&rsquo;s, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you get a rope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt shook his head. He knew that a
search for such an article would take too much
precious time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you hold on, old chap. Keep up a
good heart and we&rsquo;ll get you out of that, never
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to his companions he hastily explained
his plan. An instant later the three Scouts were
rushing down the crazy stone staircase headed
for the opening above Rob. As soon as they
reached it Merritt peered out. Rob was still
there, but he looked up appealingly at his chum.
Merritt knew what the look meant. Rob couldn&rsquo;t
hold on much longer, but dared not waste breath
in speaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, fellows,&rdquo; spoke Merritt, turning
to his chums, &ldquo;what we&rsquo;re going to do is easy
enough if you keep cool; but if you get rattled
it may fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep cool all right, Merritt,&rdquo; Fred assured
him, though his breath was coming fast.</p>
<p>As for Tubby, his countenance did not betray
the flicker of a muscle. Merritt knew he could
rely on the fat boy, but of Fred&rsquo;s more emotional
nature he had not been quite so sure.</p>
<p>Suddenly his eye caught sight of something
that would make his task easier. In the wall of
the opening was a big, rusty iron staple. What
its former use had been there was no means of
guessing; but Merritt regarded it with delight.
It made the daring thing he was about to attempt
a little more certain of success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tubby, you just hook your belt through that
staple,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and then hang on to Fred&rsquo;s
feet for all you are worth. Fred, you lie down
right here,&mdash;with your hands just at the edge,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The boys obeyed Merritt&rsquo;s orders, but Tubby
looked at him with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never do it,&rdquo; he quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, of course I will, if you fellows
carry out your part. It&rsquo;s nothing more than wall
scaling, only we&rsquo;re doing it the other way round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all was ready Tubby was lying flat with
his belt hooked through the iron staple. He had
fast hold of Fred&rsquo;s ankles, while the latter&rsquo;s
hands came just to the edge of the opening.
Merritt was to form the last link in this human
chain that was to rescue Rob Blake, if such a
thing was possible.</p>
<p>Merritt had already seen that the bush to
which Rob clung was not more than four feet
below the opening. His daring plan was to lower
himself,&mdash;with Fred clinging to his ankles,&mdash;till
he could reach Rob&rsquo;s hands and help him up to
safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Without a word Merritt threw himself on his
stomach, after taking off his coat and hat, and
wriggled to the edge. One look at Rob&rsquo;s upturned
face told him that he had no time to lose. Seconds,
yes, fractions of seconds, would count now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch hold, Fred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred gripped the daring Scout&rsquo;s ankles tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hang on like grim death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt clenched his teeth and slowly wriggled
his way over the edge. Hanging head downward
he extended his hands toward the shrub
where Rob was clinging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on for your lives!&rdquo; he shouted to those
above, and then to Rob:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go with one hand and grab my right
wrist, Rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Rob hesitated. He <i>dared</i> not
let go. But again came Merritt&rsquo;s voice. This
time it was sharp and imperative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go and grab me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Rob&rsquo;s grip with his left was relaxed and he
seized Merritt&rsquo;s wrist, giving it a jerk that almost
pulled his arm out of the socket. For an instant
his heart was in his mouth. If the boys above
weren&rsquo;t strong enough to hold them, they would
both be dashed downward to the ground that
looked so fearfully far below. But both Tubby
and Fred were heavy youths, and then, too, the
belt that was looped through that accommodating
iron staple was an anchor in itself.</p>
<p>There was a slight give and a sag, but the
&ldquo;human chain&rdquo; held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the other hand,&rdquo; ordered Merritt, drawing
a breath of relief.</p>
<p>Rob obeyed instantly this time. But he was a
fairly heavy youth and it was a good thing that
he could take part of the weight off his rescuer&rsquo;s
arms by digging his toes into the cracks of the
ruinous tower. Otherwise this story might have
had a different ending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Rob, use me as a ladder. Don&rsquo;t look
down for heaven&rsquo;s sake, but reach up and grab
my belt. Use the cracks in the wall like the rungs
of a ladder and clamber up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me rest a minute. I&rsquo;m winded and dizzy,&rdquo;
breathed Rob, whose nerve was badly shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a minute. Go on now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt spoke sharply purposely. Rob rallied
and did as he was told. He seized Merritt&rsquo;s belt
as the other boy hung head downward, and, digging
his toes into the cracks of the wall, he drew
himself up till he could, with his other hand, lay
hold of the edge of the opening. After this it was
an easy matter, thanks to the ruinous condition of
the wall which offered plenty of foothold, to
clamber to safety. Reaching it, Rob lay back
white and panting.</p>
<p>But in a few seconds he was able to help his
chums haul the courageous Merritt out of
danger.</p>
<p>It was some time before they felt able to leave
the ruined tower, such a bad shaking up had all
their nerves received; but at last a move was
made. Needless to say, the Scout totems were
not flung to the breeze that day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we ever did it,&rdquo; exclaimed
Fred, as they reached the ground and Tubby
began taking pictures of the tower while the
others looked up at the spot where Rob had clung
in such dire peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess &lsquo;being prepared,&rsquo; having good,
healthy muscles and all that had a whole heap to
do with it,&rdquo; said Tubby, snapping his shutter;
&ldquo;and now let&rsquo;s get a move on and get back to
dinner, or second breakfast, as they call it here.
I don&rsquo;t know how you fellows feel, but I&rsquo;m one
aching void.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE GATUN DAM.</span></h2>
<p>The scene changes to a day when the boys had
their first view of the mighty Gatun Dam, a work
that, as President Taft said, is &ldquo;as solid as the
everlasting hills.&rdquo; Picture a vast valley hemmed
in by hills heavily timbered with tropical growth.
Across the valley floor the current of the muddy
Chagres slowly serpentines, with workmen&rsquo;s
huts clustered along its sides, and everywhere
preparations being made to hem it in, much as
the Liliputians set about harnessing Gulliver, a
giant to them.</p>
<div class="img" id="p204">
<img src="images/p204.jpg" alt="The boys had their first view of the mighty Gatun Dam." width="500" height="649" />
<p class="center">The boys had their first view of the mighty Gatun Dam.</p>
</div>
<p>The floor of the valley, once a trackless jungle
and destined within a short time from the
moment that the Boy Scouts gazed upon it to
become a mighty lake, was crisscrossed in every
direction by lines of railroad along which contractors&rsquo;
engines were puffing and hauling long
winding trains of dirt cars. In places, great
steam shovels were at work eating out whole hillsides,
taking great mouthfuls at a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Tubby eating pie,&rdquo; laughed Merritt, as
he watched one of them.</p>
<p>Across the valley floor, the huge dam, a veritable
mountain of concrete, was rising. Busy
human ants swarmed everywhere and, at the spot
on which the boys stood, with Mr. Mainwaring
and some assistant engineers to explain things,
hundreds of black workmen were working like
beavers on the summit of the great wall. Where
they stood the wonderful dam was 100 feet wide,
just one-fourth the length of the steamer on
which they had come to the Isthmus.</p>
<p>At the base of the dam the width of the gigantic
structure is 1,900 feet, and its massive foundations
go down into the earth for many feet more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob, aglow with the
wonder of it all, &ldquo;before long all this valley floor
will be a huge inland sea across which vessels can
push their way from Pedro Miguel to Gatun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>The roar of an excavating machine drowned
his comrades&rsquo; replies, but their looks showed how
deeply they were impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes you feel like a&mdash;a fly speck,&rdquo; exclaimed
Tubby, when the uproar ceased for an
instant.</p>
<p>Up along a line of rails glided a movable steam
shovel. On a side track a busy little locomotive
had already bunted a train of flat cars. There
was a loud clatter of chains; two white spouts of
steam leaped high above the shelter which protected
the steam shovel&rsquo;s engineer from the burning
sun. Down swung the huge steel dipper.
Almost like a hungry human being, rather like
some famished giant, it swung its iron-toothed
jaws apart and bit deep into a bank which had to
be moved. In an instant its mouth was closed
again and the receptacle was full of rough,
broken material. Big rocks were among the
earth, but that made no difference to this devouring
leviathan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; shouted a big shining negro man on the
flat car.</p>
<p>The big steam shovel gave a sharp scream of
warning, the steam spurted forth again from the
vent pipes and up swung the load. The long arm
slowly reached out above the flat car. A mighty
scampering of the negro loaders followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; came the cry of the boss negro again.</p>
<p>The bottom of the dipper opened. There was
a roar of falling rock and earth and a flat car
was filled. Then the process was repeated till
the hillock that was to be removed melted away
like a plate of ice cream before a healthy boy.</p>
<p>Thus, amid shouting, seeming confusion, the
clanging and crash of metal, the scream of steam
whistles, shouted orders and the noise of steam
and the fog of smoke, the work went on,&mdash;the
mighty job that Uncle Sam, contractor, is putting
through for the benefit of the civilized world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring told the boys that there is
keen rivalry among the steam-shovel men.
Prizes are given every month for the record
amount of dirt that flies. Each shovel is pushed
to the limit of its capacity. In an eight-hour day
one of the steam shovels excavated and loaded on
flat cars 3,500 cubic yards. This means about
160 carloads for the day, or a carload every three
minutes.</p>
<p>The boys noticed, too, that the negroes,
Italians and Spaniards toiled away at their tasks
without appearing to take much interest in their
work beyond keeping just hard enough at it to
avoid getting into trouble. But on the faces of
the &ldquo;gold-men,&rdquo; as the engineers and American
officials are termed, was the stern determination
of men animated by a great purpose. Off duty,
the gold-men, so called because they are paid in
American gold and not in Panama coinage, are
a joking, jolly lot of men, who like to play tennis
and baseball, and indulge in all sorts of sports.
But on duty, clad in khaki and gaiters, with great
sun helmets to keep off the baleful rays of the
tropical sun, they are like changed men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>The expression the boys noticed on their faces
as they hurried about with blue prints or levels
and theodolites was set and stern. They seemed
to be, in a way, instruments of a great destiny.
Each bore himself as if he knew that the work in
hand required the best that was in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Mainwaring, &ldquo;that
these great steam shovels and their crews, the
activity and all the purposeful bustle and hustle
down here, represent more fully than anything
that I have ever seen the determined, fearless
American spirit that has overridden what appeared
to be impossibilities, and is carrying the
Canal through to a triumphant completion. It&rsquo;s
a great thing for a boy to be able to say that he
has seen such a work, and it will be a still greater
thing if he takes to heart the lessons to be learned
here on every hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Here he looked at Tubby who, not paying any
attention to this &ldquo;preachifying,&rdquo; as he mentally
termed it, was drinking the milk out of a cocoanut.
The fat boy had become very fond of the
cocoanut, which can be bought on the Isthmus
for little or nothing. He had slung several
around his waist and at intervals, amidst the dust
and turmoil of the work on the great dam, he
refreshed himself by a copious draught of their
cool contents.</p>
<p>At the boys&rsquo; feet, as they stood on the lofty
concrete battlement, lay the cut for the Gatun
locks, which will raise and lower vessels eighty-five
feet. There are no such locks anywhere in
the world. While the boys watched, a steady
stream of concrete was being poured into giant
moulds for the locks, and rows of arc-light poles,
like gaunt trees, showed that under the glare of
electric lights the work was pushed forward even
at night. Not a minute of time was wasted all
through that vast system. They soon had become
aware of that.</p>
<p>While the boys stood there an erect, military-looking
man came up to Mr. Mainwaring, who
greeted him with every appearance of respect.
The newcomer was tall, bore an air of authority,
and was dressed in a white military uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; the boys heard Mr. Mainwaring
say, after a few minutes&rsquo; grave conversation, &ldquo;I
wish to introduce to you my son Fred and his
three chums,&mdash;all, as you see, Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tubby hastened to chuck his empty cocoanut
shell off the top of the dam as he saw that a social
ceremony was going forward. The shell lit on
a negro&rsquo;s skull far below and bounded off with a
loud crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah goodness, dem musquitoes is wusser dan
ebber to-day,&rdquo; the negro remarked to the man
shoveling at his side, which would have made
Tubby laugh if he had heard it.</p>
<p>After a few kind words to the chums, the
military-looking man passed on, stopping every
now and then to examine the work with every
appearance of minutest care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what kind of a boss he is?&rdquo; remarked
Tubby nonchalantly after he had passed on.
&ldquo;Steam shovel boss, concrete boss, dynamite boss,
engineering boss or surveying boss,&mdash;there are
other kinds but I forget &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you chump,&rdquo; roared Fred, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
know who that was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch his name,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t anybody more important
than Lieut.-Col. George W. Goethals, chairman
of the Isthmian Canal Commission, and known
as the &lsquo;man who dug the ditch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-h-h!&rdquo; mumbled Tubby, a great light
breaking upon him, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll take another
cocoanut on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the fat boy selected a fine specimen from
the several that adorned his belt like scalps hanging
round an Indian warrior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">A DYNAMITE VOLCANO.</span></h2>
<p>After a while, despite the thrilling novelty of
the scene and the significant interest it held for
the four American lads, the dust, the heat, the
noise and the confusion and bustle became wearisome,
and they began looking about, boy like, for
something new.</p>
<p>A white man in a duck uniform and pith helmet
hastened by in company with a colored man
who looked different from any negro the boys
had yet seen. The man had straight black hair,
long and glossy. He wore a small sort of skull
cap and white clothes with odd velvet shoes not
unlike those affected by Chinese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Raynor!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Mainwaring to
the white man, as the pair hustled by along the
rampart-like heights of the big dam, &ldquo;where are
you bound for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>The dark man and his companion came to a
halt, the former standing in a respectful attitude
and saluting Mr. Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to shoot a test hole,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind taking these lads along? As
you see, they are Boy Scouts, and anxious to see
all that they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be delighted to. I&rsquo;ve a kid brother at
home whose letters are full of the doings of his
patrol. Come along, young men. I&rsquo;ll show you
something that will make your eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you here in time for dinner,&rdquo; said
Mr. Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; rejoined Tubby, whose eyes
had brightened at the mention of a meal. Although
he had devoured the milk and creamy
meat of two huge cocoanuts, the stout youth was
still ready for another chance at edibles.</p>
<p>Mr. Raynor hastened on, beckoning to the boys
to follow him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is a test hole?&rdquo; asked Rob, as the boys
trudged along the top of the dam beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a hole blown in the ground so that we
can tell what sort of foundation we are working
on,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blown in the ground?&rdquo; asked Tubby with
round inquiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Dynamited, perhaps I should have said.
Ram Chunda there,&rdquo; he motioned back at the
dark man who was trotting along behind, &ldquo;is the
boss dynamiter. He&rsquo;s going to shoot the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a Hindoo?&rdquo; exclaimed Rob as he
heard the name of the dark satellite. &ldquo;We
thought he was a negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We couldn&rsquo;t trust negroes with
dynamite. Almost all the dynamite men on the
canal are Hindoos. They are not fit for the
heavy work; but we find them reliable and trust-worthy
around explosives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Merritt presently, indicating
a small hut painted a bright red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dynamite hut. See, there are several
workmen waiting to have explosives served
out to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can anybody get the stuff who wants it?&rdquo;
asked Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. That would never do. They
have to bring an order signed by the boss on their
particular section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ram Chunda, however, appeared to have his
supply of explosives elsewhere for they did not
stop at the dynamite hut but passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much dynamite is stored there?&rdquo; asked
Rob, as they hurried along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, enough to blow the whole dam up, I
guess,&rdquo; was the careless reply, to which the boys
did not attach much significance at the time,
although they were to recollect those words with
peculiar vividness later.</p>
<p>Before long they reached a place where ladders
were stretched from the ground to the top of
the dam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down these,&rdquo; announced Mr. Raynor,
halting. &ldquo;Ram, you go first. You boys can
follow. All got steady heads, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; murmured Fred, with a vivid
recollection in his mind of the scene on the ruined
tower of St. Augustin, &ldquo;two of us have, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer did not, of course, understand
the allusion nor, to the joy of Rob and Merritt,
did he ask any explanation. Neither boy liked to
recall those awful moments when they hung suspended
in mid-air between life and death.</p>
<p>The ladders were long and steep, but the
descent was made without incident. At the
base of the dam, however, was a steep sort of
embankment of loose sand and gravel. Tubby,
who was behind Ram Chunda, looked down and
saw this, which appeared to offer a secure &ldquo;jumping
off&rdquo; place.</p>
<p>With a whoop he jumped from the last ladder
while still several feet above the top of the bank.
His feet struck it with a scrunch. But the loose,
shaly stuff was treacherous. With an alarmed
yell the fat boy, the cocoanuts round his belt rattling
like castanets, rolled down the bank, revolving
like a barrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>The others looked on in some alarm. Suddenly
Tubby struck the bottom of the bank and
simultaneously there came a series of sounds like
a volley of musketry.</p>
<p>Pop! pop! pop! pop!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, it&rsquo;s Tubby,&rdquo; cried Rob, tracing the
source of the sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he blowing up?&rdquo; demanded Fred Mainwaring
in genuine alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like it!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt apprehensively.</p>
<p>The engineer and the Hindoo looked on in
amazement. The fat boy continued to pop loudly.
Suddenly, still popping spasmodically, he struggled
to his feet. What a sight he presented!</p>
<p>He was covered from head to foot with a milky
fluid which was flowing down him and on which
the gravel had stuck and plastered him with
yellow mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tubby, are you hurt?&rdquo; yelled Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; shrilled Rob, for once, in his alarm,
giving Tubby his real first name, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
trouble? Are you injured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but those cocoanuts have blown up!&rdquo;
shouted Tubby angrily. &ldquo;One after another they
busted! I thought I was in a battle for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you look as if you&rsquo;d been through a
hard siege,&rdquo; declared Rob, who, now that his
apprehension was over, joined the others in a
hearty laugh and a scramble down the gravel
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made &rsquo;em bust?&rdquo; demanded Tubby, ruefully,
surveying his drenched uniform and brushing
himself off as best he could.</p>
<p>As soon as he could speak for laughing the
engineer explained. Cocoanuts in their natural
state are shielded by great masses of leaves which
keep their milky contents cool. Tubby, in his
greed, had girded himself about with the succulent
nuts and then spent a long morning in the
hot sun. This, combined with his activities, had
caused the milk to heat up and ferment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>If the fat boy had not taken his tumble down
the bank it is not likely that the nuts would have
exploded. But the fall was what proved too
much for the already fermented milk. Like so
much gunpowder it had expanded and blown the
&ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; or thin parts, out of each cocoanut, spraying
the unfortunate Tubby with milk, and making
the sharp series of reports that had so alarmed
them.</p>
<p>Even Ram Chunda&rsquo;s immobile face bore the
trace of a smile at Tubby&rsquo;s disaster. In fact, the
boy got no sympathy from anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pack no more cocoanuts with me,&rdquo; he was
heard to mutter, &ldquo;they are as dangerous as
Anarchists&rsquo; bombs and a whole lot messier. Gee,
my uniform&rsquo;s a sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the unanimous verdict seemed to be
&ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo; Tubby had few remarks on
his disaster to offer for the public benefit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Ram Chunda approached a small hut painted
red like the other dynamite shed, and came out
with his arms laden with what were apparently
cylindrical tin cans. He selected a number of
these, handling them with no more apparent care
than if they had been tins of tomatoes, instead
of charges of dynamite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-t-t-tell him to be a little c-c-c-careful, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; begged Tubby. &ldquo;That stuff would blow
up worse than cocoanuts if he dropped it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d never know what struck us,&rdquo; said
the engineer carelessly, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t worry about
Ram, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with the indifference of one who
has handled high explosives for years, but the
boys&rsquo; emotions were very different. They eyed
Ram Chunda askance as he stumbled occasionally
on a rock or hillock of earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>In this manner they walked quite a distance
back from the dam to a point where no tracks
or workmen were visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here is where, before long, we are
going to build a wing dam to strengthen the
main one,&rdquo; explained the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the use of blowing it up?&rdquo; asked
Tubby stolidly. The fat boy was, to tell the
truth, in a state of alarm over what was to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we want to see just what lies underneath
before we start to dig a foundation, otherwise
it would be so much wasted labor,&rdquo; was the
response.</p>
<p>There were already several test holes drilled
in the ground, but the object of dynamiting was
to loosen up the soil beneath to ascertain if there
was any substratum of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see them shoot an oil well?&rdquo; asked the
engineer, as he peered about looking for a suitable
hole to start on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>The boys shook their heads. They had heard
of the operation but had never had an opportunity
to witness such a proceeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is your chance then,&rdquo; said Mr. Raynor.
&ldquo;Ram,&rdquo; calling to the Hindoo, &ldquo;we try &rsquo;um this
fellow number one shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hindoo nodded and, carrying his armful
of explosives, hurried to his boss&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! This is only Number One,&rdquo; muttered
Tubby in an alarmed undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a scare-cat, Tubby,&rdquo; laughed Merritt,
although his own heart was beating a bit
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scare-cat nothing. I&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;ll go home to
dinner. Once is quite enough to be blown up in
one morning,&rdquo; quoth the fat youth, &ldquo;besides, I
promised my mother I wouldn&rsquo;t get into danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess over-eating is the only danger you&rsquo;ll
be in,&rdquo; chortled Fred.</p>
<p>Tubby looked pained but said nothing. With
round eyes he began to watch the proceedings
of the Hindoo &ldquo;dynamite man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>The latter cautiously lowered into the hole
selected several of his tin cylinders. The rest
of the operation, as Mr. Raynor had explained,
would be similar to that of shooting an oil well.
That is to say, a heavy cylindrical iron weight
would be dropped on the explosive mass at the
bottom of the hole, causing it to detonate.</p>
<p>With as much care now as if he were handling
eggs, Ram lowered the final cylinder of dynamite
into the hole. Then he attached a long
string to the weight and gave a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back to a safe distance, boys,&rdquo; cried Mr.
Raynor, running toward them.</p>
<p>They needed no second warning, but beat a
rapid retreat toward the great concrete rampart
of the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d climb over to the other side if I had the
time,&rdquo; Tubby declared, feeling perhaps that he
would be safe enough behind that man-made cliff.</p>
<p>At last all was in readiness. Some laborers
near at hand, glad of any excuse to drop work,
laid down their shovels to see what would happen
when the &ldquo;Go-devil,&rdquo; as they called it, was set
off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Mr. Raynor gave a look behind him at Ram
who was crouching low at quite a distance from
the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Ram gave the string a jerk and dropped it.
Then he too started sprinting toward the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dropped it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Raynor.
&ldquo;Watch it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to the boys as if Ram, swiftly as
he ran, would never get to a place of safety.
Their hearts fairly stood in their mouths as they
watched him running like a greyhound.</p>
<p>Suddenly came a subdued roar. The earth
shook. The solid ground trembled as if it had
been a jelly. A second later, from the mouth of
the hole there shot a mighty column of earth,
stones and smoke. It was accompanied by a
screaming, whistling sound and then came the
detonation of a mighty roar. Up and up shot
the column as if it meant to pierce the blue sky.
The workmen shouted and ran for places of
safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Raynor, who had been watching
with hawk-like eyes, gave a sharp, commanding
cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, boys! Run for your lives! After me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant they hesitated. Why should
they run? There appeared to be no danger. At
the distance that they were from the spouting
column it did not appear possible that they would
be in jeopardy from it even when it collapsed and
came crashing to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to ask questions. Run! Run!
Run, I tell you!&rdquo; roared the engineer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BOYS MEET AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
<p>The boys needed no further urging. Taking
to their heels they ran like so many scared jackrabbits
after the engineer. Tubby, his fat,
stumpy legs working like piston rods, was in the
lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew something was going to bust,&rdquo; he
yelled, as he sprinted along, &ldquo;and it has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Raynor, who was heading apparently
for a piled-up mass of rocks, stopped and
glanced back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late! Duck!&rdquo; he shouted the next instant.</p>
<p>Down flopped the boys, but as they threw
themselves face downward they felt as if they
were being lifted from the ground by a giant
hand and then slammed down again. It seemed
almost as if a heavy weight had been hurled
down on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Then came a terrific, blasting roar and blinding
flash as if a huge gun had been set off quite
close to them.</p>
<p>The fearful concussion and their lack of
knowledge of what was happening scared and
shocked them half out of their wits. Gravel and
small rocks fell about them. If it had not been
for their broad-brimmed Scout hats, which protected
the back of their heads, they would have
been cut and bruised by the hail of d&eacute;bris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get up now,&rdquo; came Mr. Raynor&rsquo;s
voice presently, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind saying that
that was about as narrow a squeak as I&rsquo;ve ever
experienced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure <i>was</i> a test hole,&rdquo; muttered Tubby; &ldquo;it
tested me all right and I don&rsquo;t want any more
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth happened?&rdquo; demanded Rob,
brushing dirt and dust from his uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the world was coming to an end,&rdquo;
declared Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a giant cocoanut was blowing up,&rdquo; murmured
Tubby.</p>
<p>At that moment Ram came running up. He
looked embarrassed and dabbed at a small cut
on his forehead with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him hurte you?&rdquo; he asked rather anxiously,
looking askance at Mr. Raynor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More good luck than thanks to you that we
were not all killed,&rdquo; declared the engineer angrily.
&ldquo;What made you do it, you rascal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me very sorry. Ram forget,&rdquo; said the man
contritely.</p>
<p>But his repentance had no effect on the thoroughly
angry engineer. He told the man that
he was too grossly careless to work on the dynamite
gang and ordered him to report at his office
that night and be assigned to some other work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Tubby nodded sagely as he heard this. He was
confirmed, it seemed, in his opinion that the man
had been careless and he felt like telling the
engineer so. But Rob asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us yet just what it was that
happened?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what was it?&rdquo; put in Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing to speak of but an explosion of
fifteen pounds of dynamite about as close to us as
I&rsquo;d care to have such a thing happen,&rdquo; said the
engineer grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! As bad as that!&rdquo; exclaimed Merritt
looking aghast. &ldquo;Why we might all have
been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoisted sky-high. Oh, you don&rsquo;t need to tell
me that. That careless fellow Ram left one of his
cans of dynamite lying on the ground not far
from the test hole. I didn&rsquo;t notice it and he
didn&rsquo;t either, I guess, till he shot the well. Then
just as that column of stones and stuff was sky-hooting
up, I happened to see that can lying
there. It gave me a turn, I tell you. I figured
out what would happen if a rock ever hit and
we standing where we were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What would have happened?&rdquo; asked Tubby
innocently, his eyes like two saucers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happened! Why we&rsquo;d all have had through
tickets to Kingdom Come, that&rsquo;s what would have
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told it all,&rdquo; exclaimed Rob,
who had just comprehended something. &ldquo;Boys,
that weight that fell on us was Mr. Raynor&rsquo;s
body. He just shoved us in front of him and
shielded us with his own body. He saved our
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call being a real hero,&rdquo; cried
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers and a tiger for Mr. Raynor!&rdquo;
yelled Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! You drop that now!&rdquo; protested the
engineer. &ldquo;I just fell on you because I couldn&rsquo;t
help it, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know better than that, don&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo;
cried Rob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we do,&rdquo; was the response given with
deep conviction and unanimity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say no more about it,&rdquo; begged the engineer.
&ldquo;I promised to take good care of you
and I was almost responsible for getting you
injured, so I guess we&rsquo;re quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Raynor had to visit other parts of the
workings, and also to take samples of the earth
blown up by Ram&rsquo;s unlucky blast, the boys bade
him good-bye soon after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll drop
in and see me some time if you are going to be
about here long. I may have something else
interesting to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys said they would. Then up came
Ram Chunda, grinning like a monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me velly solly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;white sahib no be
mad. You come see me some time, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll come and see you when you&rsquo;re in
your little casket or else get our lives insured
first, you&mdash;you anarchist you!&rdquo; sputtered Tubby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>The engineer had advised them not to climb
the ladders but to walk along the foot of the
dam till they reached a place where a flight of
steps had been moulded in the concrete. Accordingly,
after leaving him they trudged along at
the foot of the gigantic stone cliff, looking up
every now and then to marvel at its height and
massiveness.</p>
<p>They found plenty to look at and were in no
hurry. That is, none of them was in a hurry
but Tubby, who was keen to find out if it was
not time to go back to Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s bungalow
for dinner.</p>
<p>It was hot work walking, and they paused frequently.
At length they came to a place where
a small tree at the foot of the dam afforded a
patch of shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down and rest a while,&rdquo; said Fred.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tuckered out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish this was a cocoanut tree,&rdquo; said Tubby
as they reclined in the grateful bit of shade. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
climb it and get all you fellows something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or blow us up,&rdquo; laughed Fred mischievously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; said Rob presently, &ldquo;look up
above us on the top of the dam. There&rsquo;s a big
concrete mixing machine up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they don&rsquo;t drop anything down on us,&rdquo;
said Fred apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much danger of that, I just saw a man
peeking down at us. They would warn us if
we were in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, those niggers are none too
careful. Remember that fellow Ram; he came
pretty near ramming us,&rdquo; punned Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; yelled Merritt suddenly.</p>
<p>But he was too late. A bucket full of liquid
cement came spattering down on them, going all
over their uniforms and making them sad sights
indeed. Luckily the stuff was almost as thin
as water or they might have been injured.</p>
<p>Rob looked up and gave an indignant shout.
A mocking face peered over the edge of the
parapet and grinned jeeringly at him. As he
saw this countenance Rob gave a violent start
and fairly staggered backward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>It was the face of Jared Applegate into which
he had looked. It was his hand that had thrown
the bucket of liquid cement over them, ruining
their uniforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows!&rdquo; shouted Rob in high excitement.</p>
<p>But Jared&rsquo;s face had vanished as swiftly as it
had appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">ALONG THE CHAGRES.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you ever!! Jared of all people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is he doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; was Rob&rsquo;s reply to the
last exclamation, which had proceeded from
Tubby following Rob&rsquo;s hasty recital of what he
had seen on the top of the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Jared
is a pretty slick sort of article, or, at any rate, the
men with whom he is in league are cunning and
clever. What better place could Jared be,
watched as he is, than holding down a job as a
canal worker, bossing some small undertaking?
Who would ever dream of looking for him in such
a position?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Fred, &ldquo;and then, too, he
gets a chance to survey the ground thoroughly
and lay plans for whatever sort of deviltry that
gang is up to. Maybe Alverado and Estrada are
working on menial jobs, too, with the same end
in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite likely,&rdquo; replied Rob, &ldquo;and also that
mysterious chap we&rsquo;ve seen with Jared on several
occasions. Anyhow, our duty now is plain
enough. We must make all haste back to Mr.
Mainwaring and report to him what we have
discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some of this mess cleaned off us
first,&rdquo; said the practical Merritt. &ldquo;We look more
like drowned rats than Scouts, in our present
plight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys set to work trying to remove the
traces of the ducking that had been given them
by the malignant Jared, who had undoubtedly
recognized them. Had they known that he was
actually on the lookout for them, they would
have been much astonished. Yet such was the
case, as will appear before long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Luckily the mixture of cement that had been
doused over them was a very watery one, the
rinsings of a cement bucket, in fact, so that in
a short time the hot sun had dried out most of
the traces of their adventure.</p>
<p>But Mr. Mainwaring greeted them with exclamations
of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world have you lads been up to
now,&rdquo; he exclaimed half laughingly as they rejoined
him, &ldquo;taking a swim with your uniforms
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we did have an involuntary bath,&rdquo; admitted
Rob, and he went on to tell just what had
happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Mainwaring when he
had finished, &ldquo;this is getting interesting, and
perhaps explains many annoying things that
have been happening about here recently. Derrick
booms have collapsed without apparent cause
and an investigation has shown that acid has
been poured on the supporting ropes by some
malignantly disposed persons. Blasts have been
set off prematurely, narrowly avoiding injury,
and the work has been delayed by many such
tricks. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit if your
friend Jared and the Latin Americans who are
interested in delaying the canal construction are
at the bottom of this. I&rsquo;ll dispatch men at once
to get hold of this chap Jared and we&rsquo;ll make
him confess all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a sudden crash behind
him as a workman, who had been standing close
to him and who must have overheard every word,
dropped a heavy bucket. They all faced round
and saw a man shuffling off rapidly. Something
familiar about him struck Rob, but for the life
of him he could not place the man. It was not
until later that he recalled where they had seen
him before. He was the man who had driven
them to the ruins of old Panama on that memorable
morning, and who must have heard some of
their talk. But what was he doing on the canal
work? Was he allied with the forces that were
trying to defeat the completion of the canal?
Had he told the plotters of what he had overheard
and warned them that vigilant retribution
was on their trail?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>All these were questions that for the time had
to wait. Rob decided not to say anything just
then. After all he might have been mistaken.
In the meantime the searchers sent out after
Jared reported that they could not find him. Undoubtedly
after venting his malice on the boys
he had made off. Rob was not mistaken in his
identification of the cabman. The fellow was
allied with the plotters by close ties both of
nationality and sentiment. He had been set to
driving a hack in Panama so that he might carry
on his spy work without being suspected. It
was by chance that the boys had happened to
take his cab. But what he had overheard that
day had caused him to hasten to the dam and
inform his confederates, who, as Rob had
guessed, were constantly about there disguised
as workmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>In that vast enterprise, employing thousands
of laborers, it was a simple enough matter for
any able bodied men to obtain employment, and
no questions were asked so long as the laborer
proved able to earn his pay. At dinner time Mr.
Mainwaring was unusually silent. There was no
question in his mind now but that there were
plotters mingled in among the workmen. That
night orders for extra vigilance in patroling the
dam were issued, and that night, also, Mr. Mainwaring
announced that he intended to start the
next day on his search for the troublesome tributary
of the Chagres River which it was his intention
to devise a means to control.</p>
<p>As may be imagined, this was great news to
the boys, and they passed an all but sleepless
night in their room in Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s bungalow,
which stood in a row of &ldquo;gold-men&rsquo;s&rdquo; houses,
among which it was the largest and best finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>The boys&rsquo; equipment had been brought up
from Panama with them and was, as usual, all
in readiness for instant transportation. These
Boy Scouts lived up to their &ldquo;Be Prepared&rdquo;
motto all the time, and to the finest detail. When
their camping equipment had been packed up on
the submarine island everything had been stowed
away with military precision so that they knew,
without going through a lot of troublesome overhauling,
that everything, down to their small
pocket water filters, was in its right place.</p>
<p>A wagon transported their goods and chattels
to the landing place on the Chagres the next
morning, right after an early breakfast. Mr.
Raynor was to accompany his chief in the capacity
of assistant, and the surveying instruments
and other paraphernalia almost filled one of the
odd native canoes they were to use. Another
canoe held the camping outfits. But they were
not to paddle their way laboriously up the swiftly
flowing river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>To the delight of the boys a light draught
launch, fitted with powerful engines and a spidery
stern paddle wheel, was to do the towing while
they took it easy. This suited Tubby down to
the ground, and Rob&rsquo;s cup of satisfaction was
full to the brim when he learned that he and
Merritt were to alternate as engineers. As we
know, both boys were familiar with the management
of gasolene engines, and they gazed with
approval at the fourteen horse-power, twin-cylinder
engine of the <i>Pathfinder</i>, as the launch
was called.</p>
<p>Before they left, the chief of the Gatun
Guards, as the police that watched the big dam
were called, reported to Mr. Mainwaring that
nothing suspicious had occurred during the night
and also that no trace could be found of the
men wanted. This was disappointing, but the
boys were so keyed up with the expectation of
the wonders that awaited them in the tropical
forests through which the Chagres wound its
way on its higher reaches, that they gave but
scant thought to Jared and the plotters.</p>
<p>At last all was in readiness; Mr. Mainwaring,
who had the steering wheel, gave the signal to
start the engines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Rob gave the big fly-wheel a twist against the
compression, while Merritt turned on the gasolene
and set the spark. The engine gave a chug
and a snort and the big stern paddle wheel, which
gave the boat such an odd look but was necessary
for shoal water navigation, began to beat
the water.</p>
<p>The boys gave a shout and their patrol cries.
From the bow of the <i>Pathfinder</i>, as a compliment
to them, fluttered the pennants of the Eagles and
the Black Wolves, the same which it had been
designed to plant at old Panama. At the stern
waved Old Glory. Astern towed the two dugouts,
loaded deep down with &ldquo;duffle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus started a trip that was to prove one of
the most adventurous that lads ever embarked
upon &ldquo;by flood or field.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRACKLESS JUNGLE.</span></h2>
<p>As they slowly ascended the sluggish, though
powerful current of the muddy Chagres, Mr.
Raynor told them something about the object
of their expedition. In the foothills of the
Cordillero de Bando, a sort of backbone of mountains
extending throughout the length of the
Isthmus, many small rivers rise, some of which
feed the Chagres and contribute to its floods.
The largest of these, a stream known as the Rio
Chepalto, was, in the rainy season, quite a formidable
torrent. Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s idea was to
construct a dam or dig some sort of a connecting
link which would divert the waters of the
Chepalto in flood time into one of the small rivers
that flowed seaward, thus further taming the
Chagres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The Gatun valley was soon left behind and
the Chagres plunged into a steaming, luxuriant
forest. Between banks overgrown in wild profusion
with every sort of tropical growth, its
chocolate colored current flowed silently along.
In places, muddy bayous led off from the main
stream and these, the boys were told, were the
haunts of crocodiles and alligators.</p>
<p>Everywhere amidst the luxuriant tangle on
the banks were vivid splashes of color, scarlet,
yellow, and blue. These were the flowers of a
score of varieties of tropic shrubs and flowering
bushes. They filled the air with a rank, sweet
smell that was almost overpowering. From the
tangle, too, there shot up majestic trees, from
whose branches drooped long lianas, or creepers,
some of them thick as a man&rsquo;s thigh. Here was
a clump of brilliantly green and feathery bamboo,
there shot up a grove of coco-bola trees, while
once in a while, but this rarely, there loomed in
sight a group of the kings of the tropical forests&mdash;a
majestic gathering of towering mahogany
trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>There were also clumps of banana plants growing
to a height of fifteen or twenty feet, with
immense broad leaves often six feet in length.
Curiously enough, the banana bunches appeared
to be hanging upside down. Beyond the fruit
extended a stem like a snake, ending in a big
blossom something like a red-brown water lily.
There were occasional clumps of cocoanut trees,
too, at which Tubby looked with a strange mixture
of awe and longing.</p>
<p>Occasionally, through all this brilliant jungle
gaily colored parrots or a flock of screaming
macaws would fly, alarmed by the chugging of
the launch. In some of the bayous, pelicans or
big blue herons stood like sentinels on one leg,
watching the progress of the invaders. But,
beautiful as it all was, the boys missed the songs
of the woodland birds in the north. Except for
the shrieking of the parrots and macaws, or the
occasional sullen splash of some unseen creature
plunging into the river, the vast forests that
reached for miles all about them were silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Suddenly the launch came to a stop with a soft
bump. The boys looked rather alarmed. Had
they collided with some huge creature that made
its home in the tepid waters of the Chagres?
They were soon relieved of any anxiety on that
score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re aground at last,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Mainwaring in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as if you had expected such a thing
to happen,&rdquo; said Rob in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; rejoined the engineer, &ldquo;in fact,
I&rsquo;m astonished that it didn&rsquo;t happen before. The
river is full of sand banks, and sometimes it
is impossible to see the channel. I see you&rsquo;ve
got the engine stopped already. You had better
reverse now and we&rsquo;ll soon get off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that it would be quicker to go
through the forests,&rdquo; remarked Rob, when without
much trouble they &ldquo;got going&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be almost twice as quick, but nobody
knows the paths but the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; exclaimed Tubby. &ldquo;Are there Indians
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clutched his rifle with a determined look,
for of course the boys had brought their weapons
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed, plenty of them, but I guess we
won&rsquo;t see any. They are the San Blas tribe and
so small as to be almost pigmies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of them,&rdquo; cried Rob.
&ldquo;They look something like Japs only they&rsquo;ve got
big round heads and long, straight black hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Mainwaring; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
harmless enough unless their particular territory
is invaded. No white man has ever penetrated
far into their country and come back to tell the
tale. But they say that back among the forests
and mountains to which they alone know the way
are deposits of emerald and gold of priceless
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think somebody would form an expedition
and raid the place,&rdquo; said Tubby in a
war-like manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More easily said than done,&rdquo; Mr. Raynor
struck in; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been tried, but fever and poisoned
arrows wiped out all but a few poor, half-crazed
wretches who struggled back to civilization more
dead than alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they ever come down to this part of the
country?&rdquo; asked Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only occasionally, when a hunting expedition
has led them far afield,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Mainwaring.
&ldquo;This Rio Chepalto that we are going to
try to diverge runs back into their country;
but where it joins the Chagres is not forbidden
ground. Their territory begins higher up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly there came another soft bump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aground again!&rdquo; cried Rob, stopping the engine.
&ldquo;Shall I reverse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; do so at once,&rdquo; was the order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>But this time the matter of getting off the sand
bank was not so simple. The two tow ropes
attached to the canoe became entangled in the
paddle wheel as the <i>Pathfinder</i> backed up, and
they came to a stop. An investigation showed
that it might take some time to get it free. Tubby
was prompt in asking permission to go into the
forest to see if he couldn&rsquo;t bring down some
game of some kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Fred will have to go alone then,&rdquo;
said Mr. Mainwaring, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t go far from
the river. We&rsquo;ll recall you by three blasts on
the whistle. Rob and Merritt will be needed to
help us get untangled and to work the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we&rsquo;ll bring back some game that
will make their eyes bulge,&rdquo; declared Tubby
valiantly. &ldquo;Come on, Fred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I shove the landing plank ashore,&rdquo;
said Fred, catching hold of a plank that was
used for that purpose. The launch lay quite close
to the shore and the plank, which was ten feet
long, was of sufficient length to form a bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the plank,&rdquo; quoth Tubby, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just step on this old log here and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, boy!&rdquo; came a sharp cry from Mr.
Raynor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>But it was too late. Tubby had already stepped
over the side of the launch. As his foot touched
the log a surprising thing happened. What had
seemed a balk of old rotten timber gave a leap
that threw Tubby into the water, and at the
same instant a vast pair of jaws, armed with
double rows of gleaming teeth, flashed wide open.
The alligator&mdash;for that was what Tubby&rsquo;s &ldquo;log&rdquo;
was&mdash;gave a menacing, hissing sound and a
flourish of its formidable tail.</p>
<p>The next instant a rifle cracked sharply. The
creature gave a roar as a bullet crashed down
its open throat. Rob, seeing Tubby&rsquo;s peril, had
snatched Fred&rsquo;s rifle from him and pumped a
bullet into the monster reptile where it would do
the most good. He pumped the repeating mechanism
and two more bullets drove into the &rsquo;gator
before it sank, crimsoning the muddy water.
They saw no more of it and Mr. Mainwaring declared
that Rob must have killed it.</p>
<p>Tubby, up to his waist in water, gasped as he
beheld his narrow escape and Rob&rsquo;s prompt action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! This is a funny country,&rdquo; he
mumbled, after he had been lectured for his
carelessness. &ldquo;Cocoanuts explode and old rotten
logs turn into alligators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his promise to be careful and keep well
within call, Tubby was allowed to go on shore
with Fred and you may be sure he used the landing
plank this time. The two boys struck off
straight into the jungle and then kept a course
that lay parallel to the river bank. All at once
Tubby gave a violent exclamation and almost fell
over backward. A lizard, but a lizard almost as
big as himself, had run through the jungle right
in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Panama water-lizard,&rdquo; declared Fred, who
had put in more time studying the country from
books than had Tubby. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look so,&rdquo; was Tubby&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>But a more thrilling encounter lay just ahead
of them. Hanging from a tree, and slowly swaying
to and fro, was what looked like a beautifully
marked liana or hanging creeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a beauty,&rdquo; exclaimed Fred, stepping
forward, but the next instant he recoiled with a
yell of alarm.</p>
<p>The creeper had emitted a loud, angry hiss
and then they saw that it was no creeper at all,
but a brilliantly colored snake, at least fifteen
feet long, that was swinging from a limb around
which its tail was coiled. Tubby echoed Fred&rsquo;s
yell of alarm and the next instant both boys took
to their heels in mad flight. The serpent had
swiftly and silently begun writhing its way to
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run for your life!&rdquo; cried Tubby wildly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stumbling over creepers, falling headlong, and
then struggling to their feet again, and keeping
on with their mad rush, the two terrified boys
ran for their lives. Behind them came a thrashing
sound as the big snake made its way after
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>In their alarm they lost all sense of direction
or distance. All they knew was that the big
reptile was pursuing them, and they raced along
without considering anything but escaping from
it. It never even occurred to them to open fire
on it with their rifles.</p>
<p>How far they ran they had no idea. All they
knew was that at last, when, from sheer exhaustion
they paused, there was no sound of pursuit.
The vast woods were silent. All at once they
had a fresh fright. This time from overhead.
There was a mighty commotion in the tree-tops
accompanied by shrill barks and cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, what&rsquo;s coming now?&rdquo; gasped
Tubby. &ldquo;I wish we were back on the launch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was only a troop of white-faced, long-tailed
monkeys swinging by, traveling along the
tree-top high road at almost incredible speed.
They paused as they saw the boys standing there
below them. Gathering together they began to
chatter and make a terrible noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Then, making horrible grimaces and yelling
angrily, they broke off sticks and began to pelt
the two lads furiously with them. Suddenly
Tubby raised his rifle and fired at them. Instantly
they made off, shrieking at the top of their
voices and swinging from limb to limb by means
of their long tails which they used as conveniently
as hands.</p>
<p>The monkeys gone with their bewildering
chatter, the boys began to look about them.
They were standing in a spot where the undergrowth
was not so dense, but they could see that
they were in the depths of the forest. As they
looked around them the same thought clutched
uncomfortably hard at the heart of each. How
far had they come on their wild run to escape
the great serpent? Also, in what direction had
their retreat led them? Tubby was the first to
give these disquieting thoughts words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Haven&rsquo;t you got your compass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t take any bearings when we
left the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strike out and try to get back. At any
rate we&rsquo;ll hear the whistle before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. I forgot that. Better sit down
here and wait till we hear it, then. No use wandering
about, we might go in a wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But had the boys known it, the launch whistle,
not a very powerful one, was at that very minute
blowing repeatedly for them. Their wild dash
to escape from the huge snake had carried them
far into the jungle.</p>
<p>They sat there for a long time, each busied
with his own thoughts. At last Tubby rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny we don&rsquo;t hear that whistle, Fred,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been thinking that maybe we
ran further than we thought from that beast in
the tree. Now I&rsquo;m pretty sure the river lies that
way,&rdquo; he pointed in a directly opposite direction.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strike out for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Fred, whose face had
begun to assume an alarmed look. &ldquo;S-s-s-s-say,
Tubby, you don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re lost, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Tubby was quick to note the quaver in Fred&rsquo;s
voice, and he bravely put on a careless air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost! Not a bit of it. Two Boy Scouts lost
in a bit of timber like this? Not much. Come
on, old chap, and we&rsquo;ll be laughing over our scare
within an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hour after hour went by and still the two
lads, now thoroughly scared, though neither had
yet admitted it, plunged along through the jungle.
At last when they reached a small open space,
Fred could stand it no longer. He sank down
on a fallen tree trunk and fairly gave way to his
fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost, Tubby,&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s no
use going any further. I can&rsquo;t, in fact. I&rsquo;m
dead tired out. What on earth shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>The fat boy looked at his comrade with alarmed
eyes. It was plain that Fred was on the verge
of a nervous collapse. Their position was bad
enough without that. And yet Tubby could find
no words to comfort his companion. What Fred
had said was the truth; they were lost in the
trackless jungle, a terrifying situation indeed.
From time to time during their wanderings they
had fired their rifles, hoping to hear some response,
but none had come.</p>
<p>Tubby, however, had, whenever possible,
marked the trail either by barking or blazing a
tree with his knife in Indian fashion, or by leaving
grass and stone signs in a manner familiar
to all first-class Scouts. This was now the only
crumb of comfort he could offer to Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up. Maybe they&rsquo;ll pick up the trail,&rdquo;
he said as hopefully as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they don&rsquo;t, we&mdash;gracious! Look
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Facing the two lost boys was a party of squat,
copper-colored little men with big round heads
and straight black hair. They carried bows and
arrows and spears. Their clothes consisted of
old sacking, bits of cloth, anything in fact that
would partially cover them. They evidently
formed a hunting party, for some of them carried
wild pigs and one or two had a deer slung on
a branch between them. They had crept up quite
silently and now regarded the interlopers intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>For an instant the two white boys stood
stock-still, as if turned to stone. Then by a
natural impulse, they turned and started to run.
But a spear whizzed through the air after them,
transfixing itself quivering in a tree just above
their heads.</p>
<div class="img" id="p262">

<p class="center">For an instant the two white boys stood stock-still, as if turned to stone.</p>
</div>
<p>This brought them to a halt. Weapons they
had none, for when they paused they had laid
down their rifles and in their precipitate, startled
flight had forgotten to pick them up again.</p>
<p>Utterly unnerved by this added sheaf to their
bundle of misfortunes, the two Boy Scouts stood
facing the Indians who, they had no doubt,
formed a hunting or scouting party sent out by
the San Blas tribes that made their homes back
in the mysterious recesses of the mountains
where rose the headwaters of the Chepalta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.</span></h2>
<p>In the meantime Rob and Merritt, working
waist deep in the muddy shallows, had succeeded,
after some rather arduous work, in clearing the
stern wheel of its entangling rope. The line had
become twisted in and out of the shaft in such
a way that it was necessary in places to cut it
loose.</p>
<p>When this had been done, Mr. Mainwaring
decided that before blowing the whistle to summon
back the young hunters they would give
the machinery a test. Accordingly, when the
canoes had been secured to the shore, Rob reversed
the engine and started it up.</p>
<p>For a moment it whirled and chugged away,
straining to back the launch off the muddy shallows
in which she had grounded. The lightly
built craft trembled under the effort. The engine
snorted and puffed as more power was applied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! We&rsquo;re afloat once more!&rdquo; cried
Merritt triumphantly, as the launch was caught
in the current and swung free. But at the same
instant came an ominous cracking sound. The
engine raced wildly and then stopped as Rob
shut off the power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; cried Mr. Raynor
apprehensively, as the launch began to drift
downstream in a helpless way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; cried Rob, and then
the next instant, &ldquo;The driving chain has
snapped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw out the anchor before we drift any
more,&rdquo; cried Mr. Mainwaring.</p>
<p>This was done and then Rob set about making
an investigation. As he had declared, the driving
chain, which drove the stern wheel just as a
bicycle sprocket is revolved, had parted in the
middle. Undoubtedly the strain that had been
placed on it when they were backing the launch
off had proved too much for its strength.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>They regarded the accident with some dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scotland! That means we are stuck,&rdquo;
exclaimed Merritt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably, unless we can make some repairs,&rdquo;
admitted Mr. Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can fix it, Rob?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Raynor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might manage to make a temporary link
out of wire,&rdquo; replied Rob, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it
wouldn&rsquo;t hold long against the current.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a spare chain in the tool locker?&rdquo;
asked Merritt.</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing for it but to turn back and
get a new link forged,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; agreed Rob. &ldquo;Shall I make a
link out of steel wire? I guess that would be
strong enough to carry us down with the stream
if we go slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do so,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Merritt, will
you sound the return whistle for Bob Hopkins
and Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt pulled the cord connecting with the
compressed air whistle and tugged it lustily.
Then he paused and blew again, keeping this up
for some time. No reply had come; but as yet
they felt no anxiety. It was likely that the boys
would take some time in returning, and the possibility
of their being out of ear-shot of the whistle
did not occur to any of the party.</p>
<p>But when an hour had passed and then another
dragged its slow length away without
bringing any signs of the absentees, anxiety gave
place to alarm and alarm to genuine fear that
harm might have overtaken them. They looked
blankly at each other. For a time no one spoke.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from a great distance as it seemed,
there came the sound of a rifle shot.</p>
<p>Had they but known it, the sound was caused
by Tubby&rsquo;s shot at the band of monkeys. Although
ignorant of its cause, it made the dismayed
little party&rsquo;s spirits pick up a bit to hear at least
some sound of the two young hunters, even
though they knew that they must be some distance
off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Raynor,&rdquo; ordered Mr. Mainwaring, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether that shot was merely a signal that
they are coming, or a signal of distress. In any
event I am going ashore. Rob, you may come
with me if you like. Bring your rifle. Merritt,
you keep guard with Mr. Raynor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer merely nodded in answer to his
chief&rsquo;s orders. Merritt looked rather disappointed.
He would have liked to accompany the
searchers, but as he knew that was impossible
he put the best face possible on the matter and
helped Rob and Mr. Mainwaring to get ashore
by means of the plank.</p>
<p>Almost instantly the jungle swallowed them
up. As they vanished from sight, Raynor sighed.
Merritt looking up saw that he looked distressed.
He ventured to ask him what was the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just know why, my boy, but I&rsquo;ve got
an idea that the lads are in trouble in the woods
yonder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of that
distant shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think that there are any Indians
off in the forest, do you?&rdquo; asked Merritt,
turning a shade paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything. I don&rsquo;t want to say
anything till I&rsquo;m sure; but we&rsquo;re not so far from
San Blas country that a wandering hunting
party might not happen along through the forest.
They have the jungle honeycombed with paths
known only to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing&mdash;just supposing that the boys
did fall in with them, would the Indians do them
any harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible to say, Merritt. This I do know,
however, that the Indians&rsquo; minds have been
worked on by those who are opposed to the canal
until they have been taught to regard all white
men as their enemies. They have been told that
the making of the canal will flood out their hunting
grounds and drive them into remoter parts
of the country. Naturally, they regard white
men with suspicion and hatred.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>While this conversation was going on, Mr.
Mainwaring, whose face was sadly troubled, and
his young companion, had been pushing their way
through the jungle. Fortunately the trail of
Tubby and Fred was pretty well marked where
they had shoved their way through the underbrush.
Finally they came to the spot where the
two boys had met with the serpent. Rob examined
the ground with the instinct of a true
scout and skillful trapper. Traces of a sudden
stoppage and a precipitate flight off into the
jungle were plainly visible.</p>
<p>But what had caused the boys to beat such
a rapid retreat was by no means so plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make out anything, Rob?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Mainwaring, after a pause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Rob perplexedly, &ldquo;except that
something appears to have frightened them just
at this point. You can see by their footmarks in
this soft mud that they were running fast when
they made off. And see here, sir, where one of
them fell and scrambled up again, going on as
quickly as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove, you can read all that in those tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the Boy Scout training, sir,&rdquo;
rejoined Rob modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful! Wonderful! But tell me,
can you see the signs of any wild beasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one. That&rsquo;s what makes it so mysterious.
It is plain that something was after them
and yet there are no tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had better follow up the trail they
have left through the jungle. That is our only
course, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on they pursued the trail, going slowly
of necessity. Here they would lose the trail for
a time and then again in a few minutes Rob&rsquo;s
cleverness as a Scout would pick it up again by
means of a broken blade of grass or a creeper
that had been brushed aside. Never had the
young leader&rsquo;s well-trained faculties been more
on the alert than now as he followed his chum&rsquo;s
trail through the trackless jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>And all the while poor Tubby and Fred were
wandering further and further from them. At
length they reached the open space where the
boys had paused a while and Tubby had shot at
the monkeys overhead. All at once Rob darted
forward. On the ground he had spied a brass
shell. They examined it and found that it tallied
with the caliber of Tubby&rsquo;s rifle, but beyond this
there was no further clue.</p>
<p>Suddenly Rob gave a cry of delight. He
eagerly examined what appeared to Mr. Mainwaring
to be nothing more than a clump of
pampas grass slightly bent over to the left. But
Rob&rsquo;s quick eye had caught sight of a band of
grass tied round its top just below the bend. To
an ordinary person&rsquo;s eye this would have meant
nothing. But to Rob, trained in scouting, it
meant that the two lads they were pursuing had
turned to the left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>On they went again, never flagging through
the hot noonday, but patiently picking up the
trail as they went along. Now a scratch on the
bark of a limb would show Rob the direction,
presently some trampled grass or flowers led him
on, again he would stumble on one of Tubby&rsquo;s
stone or grass signs.</p>
<p>All the time the trail kept getting fresher.
Their hopes rose high.</p>
<div class="img" id="p001">
<img src="images/p001.jpg" alt="All the time the trail kept getting fresher." width="500" height="783" />
<p class="center">All the time the trail kept getting fresher.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re catching up on them,&rdquo; cried Rob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
slow but sure; we&rsquo;re catching up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently they stood in the space under the
tall trees where Tubby and Fred had paused and
where the San Blas Indians had surprised them.
Rob, like a pointer dog, went rapidly hither and
thither, crouched low, looking for the tiny signs
which mean so little to an untrained and so much
to a carefully educated eye.</p>
<p>Suddenly he gave a sharp cry. It brought Mr.
Mainwaring to his side in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, sir! Here in this soft earth! The
print of bare feet! Very small bare feet! What
does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Mainwaring, his
face working. &ldquo;The trail ends here, Rob. Oh,
my poor boy! My poor boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, quite overcome, Mr. Mainwaring sank
down on the same log on which, had he but
known it, his son Fred had collapsed but a short
time before. It was a long time that he sat
there with his head buried in his hands, and
when he raised his face Rob saw that it was
white and strangely drawn, but full of determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do, sir?&rdquo; demanded Rob.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that, as you say, there is no doubt
they have been carried off; but luckily, I see no
signs of a struggle. Perhaps there is hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring had said nothing and Rob had
not told him of his discovery of a spear that still
stuck in the tree into which it had darted quivering
above Tubby&rsquo;s head. He could not find it
in his heart to increase Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s distress,
and, agitated as he himself was, Rob had
still thoughtfulness enough not to add to another&rsquo;s
burdens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>Presently he repeated his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any plan, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring sprang to his feet; his eyes
had a hard glint in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a plan,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the only
plan that can save them. We must return at
once, get a powerful force and ransack this
forest from end to end. Perhaps if the Indians
learn of this, and learn of it they will quick
enough, they will give the boys up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, each busied with his own thoughts,
they made their way back toward the river. But
before they reached it, it began to grow dusk.
An uneasy wind sighed in the tops of the forest
trees. But for this a death-like stillness prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry. A storm is coming on,&rdquo; said
Mr. Mainwaring looking upward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>Before long they could catch the glint of the
river through the trees. But here a fresh surprise
awaited them. There lay the canoes, just
as they had left them; everything looked the
same, but of the launch there was not a sign!</p>
<p>They could hardly believe their eyes, but the
fact remained that the <i>Pathfinder</i> had vanished;
nor was there any trace of its two occupants. It
was at this moment that Rob noticed that the
river seemed to be flowing more swiftly and that
its level had risen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE RUINED CITY.</span></h2>
<p>It would have been worse than useless for
Tubby or Fred to have attempted flight, as the
stout youth had rightly conjectured. Resistance
would have been equally foolhardy. This would
have been so in any case, but any move against
the Indians was now rendered doubly dangerous
by the fact that two of the odd-looking little
natives had picked up the two rifles the boys had
so foolishly forgotten and were examining them
in a way that showed that they had knowledge
enough of the white man&rsquo;s weapons to use them,
should occasion offer.</p>
<p>After a vast deal of jabbering in their unknown
tongue, two of the Indians bound Tubby&rsquo;s
hands behind his back while the others stood
guard to protect their companions against any
sudden move. Then came Fred&rsquo;s turn. This
done, the boys were led across the open space to
a clump of trees from amidst which the Indians
had first appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>To Tubby&rsquo;s astonishment he saw that a narrow,
but well beaten trail ran through the jungle
from this point. But in what direction it led he
was, of course, ignorant. He guessed, however,
that it must be one of the secret Indian paths to
which Mr. Raynor had referred. On either side
of the narrow trail the jungle grew up thick and
impenetrable. Two Indians walked in front, then
came the boys, behind marched the other Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-w-w-what is going to become of us?&rdquo;
quavered Fred as they moved along at a swift
though steady pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I guess we are bound for some
village or other back in the San Blas country.
It&rsquo;s a good sign though that they haven&rsquo;t offered
us any violence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Fred could not but agree that this was so.
But little more talk was indulged in between the
two captives. It was not a situation that adapted
itself to conversation. Hour after hour they
trudged along through the tropical forest until
at last they came upon something startling.</p>
<p>In front of them, as they rounded a curve in
the crooked trail, there suddenly rose up something
that seemed menacingly to dispute their
further passage through the forest.</p>
<p>There, facing them, was a hideous monster
carved out of a white stone or marble, they could
not be sure which. The thing loomed ghastly
white against a background of dark trees. Spots
of rank moss grew on its glaring stone face. Its
stumpy hands were folded and tucked up on its
breast; its legs and feet, shaped like a water
creature&rsquo;s, were drawn up under its belly. But
it was the awful face with its sinister glare that
gave the boys a start that quivered through their
frames. As if in proof of its antiquity the statue
was broken in places and leaned slightly to one
side. Through the cracks in the white stone,
great, twisted, gnarled tree trunks, like serpents,
writhed in and out. Altogether it was as horrible
an object to come upon in the depths of a great
forest as the mind could conceive. Small wonder
the boys shuddered at it. The Indians, however,
did not appear to regard it with much awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What an awful looking thing!&rdquo; shuddered
Fred, who had turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! It&rsquo;s only an old idol,&rdquo; Tubby scoffed,
assuming a bold air for Fred&rsquo;s comfort. &ldquo;Lots
of &rsquo;em in this part of the world. Crackers!
Fred, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what we are coming
to one of those ancient cities that have long
been supposed to exist in this part of the world.
I think&mdash;Great C&aelig;sar! Look there, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>A wilderness of ruins suddenly opened before
them as they topped a small rise. Everywhere
was a confusion of tumbled idols, pillars, blocks
of stone, heavy walls, flights of steps, some whole,
some tumbling with decay, others still upright.
Roots, branches and curling vines writhed in and
out of the scene of desolation like great snakes.
Here and there trees shot up from the empty
walls of roofless palaces. Their restless shadows
waved mournfully above the ruins. Further back
stood a building that surmounted a sort of platform
of white stone. It was reached by a flight
of steps on one side. On the other the walls
towered up steep and slippery. They would not
have afforded foothold to a fly.</p>
<p>The Indians marched the boys up the steps
leading to this dismal palace. From the top of
the platform they could see over the ruined city
in all directions. And off to one side was a
sight that made Tubby&rsquo;s heart beat more quickly.
He had caught the glint of a river, and on its
banks he had seen three canoes drawn up. If
only they could reach that stream they might
still escape. But such a prospect appeared to be
remote in the extreme.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>They were marshaled into the chamber within
the walls they had noticed from below. It was
of massive but rude architecture and was roofless,
but the walls sloped inward, making any idea
of climbing them out of the question. From
cracks in the walls grew tropic plants and creepers.
To the boys&rsquo; surprise, once within this place,
their hands were untied. But this in itself was
a bad sign so far as hope of escape went. It
meant that the Indians knew there was no hope
of their captives getting away.</p>
<p>Two guards were set to watch them at the
door, and then the others left. The guards took
up their station at the door with their wicked-looking
spears all ready for instant action.
Tubby, with his ruling passion still strong&mdash;and
as a matter of fact he was fearfully hungry and
faint after their long march&mdash;eyed longingly
some red fruit that grew on one of the shrubs
clinging to the wall. He was about to pluck some
when Fred drew him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch those, Tubby, they&rsquo;re not good
to eat,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I recognize the leaf.
It&rsquo;s just like a deadly nightshade leaf at home.
I guess they are a giant variety of that poisonous
plant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t touch &rsquo;em. Would
they kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ate many. A few would only put you
to sleep. They contain a drug called bella-donna
which is a narcotic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then one of the natives appeared with two
earthenware bowls full of half raw meat. The
boys were hungry or they could not have touched
the stuff. As it was, they ate all they could, but
left quite a quantity. As they ate their guards
eyed them in an odd way. It looked as if they
were hungry, too, and would have liked to eat.</p>
<p>The boys could see out through the door, and,
after eating all they could, they amused themselves
by looking over the ruined city. They
could see smoke rising some distance off among
the trees, and guessed that the main camp of
the Indians was there. Probably, they guessed&mdash;and
in this they were right&mdash;the superstitious
Indians did not like to camp among the ruins of
the lost race, although they had no objection to
jailing their prisoners there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>As it grew dusk, the sky clouded over. Thunder
began to rumble in the distance and the wind
moaned in a most melancholy way among the
trees that overshadowed the ruins. Far off they
could hear the Indians shouting and singing in
a coarse, unmusical way. Seemingly they were
celebrating the success of their chase and capture
of the two white boys.</p>
<p>At any rate, they appeared to forget the two
guards utterly. It grew dark and the men still
sat there. They had lighted a small fire outside
the ruined temple, or whatever it had been, and
the glow of it revealed their still and silent
figures to the boy captives. One of them took
some kind of cake from his girdle presently and
took a bite of it. Then he offered it to his companion
who bit into it hungrily. It was plain
that the two Indians were getting hungry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Tubby was about to try to conciliate them by
offering them what the boys had left in their
bowls, when he had a sudden inspiration. He
went to the wall and began picking some of the
berries Fred had told him not to touch. Fred,
who had fallen into a fitful slumber, did not
notice him, and Tubby proceeded uninterruptedly
with what he was about.</p>
<p>It was about a quarter of an hour later and
the rumble of the approaching storm was growing
nearer and nearer when Tubby arose and,
picking up the two bowls, approached the guards.
Instantly they sprang to their feet and presented
their spear blades at him. But Tubby, by signs,
explained that he and his companion had not
been able to eat all their rations and wanted to
give them the rest.</p>
<p>As Tubby&rsquo;s shrewd mind had guessed from
what he had seen, the two guards were famished.
They saw no harm in taking the meat from the
prisoner who was kind enough to offer it. They
grabbed the bowls and in a minute, as it appeared
to the astonished fat boy, they had emptied them.
Tubby regarded the two Indians admiringly. He
had never seen edibles disposed of so swiftly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>When they had eaten, the guards became stern
again. They motioned Tubby back to the interior
of the ruinous structure. The stout boy
obeyed and sank down on the floor apparently
composing himself to sleep, but in reality he was
watching the two guards with intent eyes. Suddenly
he gave a grunt of satisfaction. The
guards began to nod sleepily. One almost fell
over. He recovered himself, but in an instant
he was off to sleep again; as for his companion,
after an ineffectual effort to awaken his comrade,
he too sank into a deep slumber, falling
across the threshold of the place.</p>
<p>Instantly Tubby was all activity. Quickly he
aroused Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! Quick! Don&rsquo;t ask questions.
Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What?&rdquo; began Fred sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. We&rsquo;ve got to move quick. I
squeezed the juice of those berries you told me
about into the remains of our supper. The
guards ate it. They&rsquo;re fast asleep. It&rsquo;s up to
us to cut and run for those canoes on the river
bank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Fred was alert in an instant. As he rose softly
to his feet a vivid flash of lightning illumined
his face. Tubby saw that it was set and determined
as became a Black Wolf Scout. He
gripped Fred&rsquo;s hand tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, keep your nerve,&rdquo; he enjoined.</p>
<p>Then, hand in hand and on tiptoe, the two
boys crept toward the doorway. As they were
stepping over one of the sleeping guards Tubby,
by the glow of the fire, saw that a small bag
that the fellow had had tied at his waist had burst
as he fell headlong in his slumber, and that a
lot of odd-looking pebbles lay scattered about
near it. Yielding to he knew not what impulse,
he stooped and stuffed a handful of the rocks
into the pocket of his Scout coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>It was work to bring the lads&rsquo; hearts into their
mouths, this advance out upon the open platform
with the firelight on them to betray their
every movement. Far off they could catch the
glow of the Indians&rsquo; campfire; but for all they
knew other guards might be about and at any
minute they expected to hear a spear or an arrow
whiz by them. But nothing of the sort happened.
They reached the river bank in safety.</p>
<p>The lightning was now flashing incessantly.
By its gleam they saw the canoes, with their
paddles alongside, lying as they had last seen
them. Tubby advanced, and, catching hold of
one, turned it over. The next instant he gave a
terrified yell. As he had turned it, there had
leaped from under it, where he had evidently
been sleeping, an Indian armed with a spear.</p>
<p>Before he could cast it, Tubby ducked low
and rushed in on the man like a young bullock.
The little San Blas native went down in the mud
with a splash. Tubby wrested the spear from
him and sent it flying. As the Indian struggled
to his feet Fred gave him a blow on the mouth
that must have driven some of his teeth in, to
judge by the sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; ordered Tubby in a tense undertone,
&ldquo;into the water with those other canoes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we only want one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em to chase us, do we?&rdquo; exclaimed
the fat boy sharply. &ldquo;Over with &rsquo;em I
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred shoved the two dugouts off. In a jiffy
the current caught them and they went sailing out
of sight. At the same instant there came another
flash of lightning. It showed the river,
swollen and angry, racing furiously along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you handle a paddle, Fred?&rdquo; asked
Tubby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I had a canoe on the Hudson,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is going to beat any Hudson you
ever saw. There&rsquo;s a storm in the mountains
evidently, and the river is rising every minute.
It can&rsquo;t be helped, though. Take a paddle and
shove off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Luckily both boys knew something about
canoes or the start of that dugout would likewise
have been its finish. But they saved it by
skillful, swift handling from a capsize. The
next instant they were in it, being hurled off at
a dizzy pace down the rushing current. Behind
them came yells and savage shouts. Their escape
had evidently been discovered, probably when a
change of guards was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; shouted Tubby back defiantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off on the Chagres Limited, you shirtless
sons of iniquity; it&rsquo;ll take better men than you
to catch us now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cranky canoe rocked wildly, and then shot
off into the darkness, hurtled along by the sweeping
current of an unknown river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;BE PREPARED.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>We must now go back to Mr. Raynor and
Merritt whom we left in the launch, a prey to
no very enviable thoughts. As the sound of
Rob&rsquo;s and Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s footsteps died away
in the forest, they fell to speculating on the fate
of their young comrades. All at once Merritt
turned to his companion with an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the river current flowing more swiftly?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Raynor gazed over the side at the muddy
stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely is,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
but there&rsquo;s a storm back in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>As the stream flowed more swiftly and with
greater volume Merritt looked with some anxiety
at their anchor rope. It was not a particularly
thick one and the stream was tugging frantically
at the launch. Suddenly, without the slightest
warning, there was a sharp snapping sound and
the rope parted. Before they had time to exchange
a word, the launch was a hundred yards
down stream. It was almost impossible to turn
her about or direct her course, but accident accomplished
for them what they had not been
able to do for themselves. The <i>Pathfinder</i> suddenly
struck a sand bank, gave a giddy sort of
yaw and swung round, heading bow on down the
stream.</p>
<p>The next instant the current which was still
rising caught her and shot her off down stream
with her bow pointing in the right direction.
Mr. Raynor grabbed the spokes of the steering
wheel before the craft had a chance to smash
into the bank and Merritt set the engine slowly
going on reverse so as to check, as much as
possible, the furious speed. He had grave doubts
of the patched-up link holding, but he nursed it
along as carefully as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>It was not till they had gone some distance
that either of them had a chance to speak, and
then naturally their first words were about those
they had left behind. What anxieties beset them
may be imagined. Two of their number were
lost; the pair that had set out to find them would
return either with or without the castaways, but
in any case to find the launch gone. That it was
all as unavoidable as fate made no difference to
the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>The <i>Pathfinder</i>, handled with consummate
skill by Mr. Raynor, reached the Gatun settlement
that evening, and the news spread like
wildfire that the boys were lost and that Mr.
Mainwaring had been left, by force of circumstances,
in the forest. Everyone there appreciated
the gravity of the situation. The river
was rising and it might be impossible to ascend
it for a week, even if then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>From the vivid flashes of lightning visible in
the far-off peaks it was clear that back in the
wild Cordillera the storm was raging savagely.
The water continued to rise. After supper Mr.
Raynor, in charge during Mr. Mainwaring&rsquo;s absence,
wrote out a telegram to Lieut. Col. Goethals
informing him of what had happened. Merritt,
who was aching for something to do, volunteered
to take it to the little telegraph office by the railroad
track; for the head official of the canal was
in Colon inspecting the work there, having left
the day before in his private car.</p>
<p>Mr. Raynor, perhaps seeing that Merritt
would feel better with some employment to take
his mind off his worry, readily consented. The
Boy Scout set out at once. As he went he looked
back at the distant peaks several times. The
lightning was playing a witches&rsquo; dance above
them, and he thought with a pang of those near
and dear to him who might be wandering at that
very moment among them.</p>
<p>The operator at the Gatun station was a talkative
chap and he chatted to Merritt while he
waited for an open wire. He told him that he
had had a busy evening and grumbled quizzically
at his own good nature in trying to please other
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, only half an hour ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a chap,
a young American, I guess, was in here and borrowed
two of my batteries. Said he was experimenting.
Well, I knew him by sight and
I let him have &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s the result? I&rsquo;ve
had to charge two more and the line don&rsquo;t work
as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt only half listened to the voluble
operator&rsquo;s relation of his troubles. But presently
he looked up languidly as the operator said
brusquely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the chap coming back now.
Well, if he&rsquo;s after any more batteries he don&rsquo;t
get &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footfall sounded on the platform outside, the
door opened and in came a man at sight of whom
Merritt almost fell off his chair. It was the
young man that he had seen in the barn with
Jared and with whom the latter had driven to
the station the night of the fire in Hampton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Merritt was sitting back in a corner. For the
sake of coolness, there was only one lamp in the
place, a shaded one above the operator&rsquo;s table.
A pile of boxes stood close to Merritt and he
slipped in behind them. He had reasons of his
own for not wanting to be seen just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more batteries,&rdquo; began the operator truculently
as the stranger came in. But the other
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not batteries this time,&rdquo; he said with a
slightly foreign accent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a telegram I want
to send.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different. There&rsquo;s one ahead of
you, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; there is no hurry. I&rsquo;ll write mine
out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sat down and rapidly wrote on a
sending blank. He handed it in. The operator
looked at it a minute and then handed it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry; I can&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I can pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man drew out a roll of bills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. Your message is in cipher and
we are not allowed to take such telegrams in the
zone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieut. Col. Goethals and the U. S. Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse them both,&rdquo; ground out the stranger
angrily. The operator jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an American
and I think Goethals is a mighty fine man, too.
See the point? There&rsquo;s the door. Now get!
I&rsquo;m blamed sorry I lent you those batteries, but
I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t return them than come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the man turned and half slunk
out of the door. As he passed close by Merritt,
the Boy Scout heard him mutter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you and all Yankees will be sorrier
yet before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>Merritt looked around. There was an open
door behind him. Quick as a flash he slipped
through it and the next moment was following
the man through a clump of bananas that grew
on each side of the road. Dodging among the
broad leaves Merritt kept his quarry in sight and
stuck close to his heels. The man walked on
and then suddenly turned aside from the main
road that led back to the &ldquo;gold-men&rsquo;s&rdquo; quarters
and headed down into a sort of wild gully running
to the river.</p>
<p>With Merritt close on his heels and blessing
the shrubs that grew at the path-side, the man,
quite unconscious that anyone was on his tracks,
kept on. At length he came to a more or less
tumble-down hut not far from the river bank.</p>
<p>He paused here a minute and gave three low
whistles. In response out came an old negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis funny time ob night to call?&rdquo; said the old
darky questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a <i>good time of night to call</i>,&rdquo; said
the man with a peculiar emphasis. To Merritt
it sounded as if the words just spoken were a sort
of countersign. At any rate nothing more was
said. The old negro admitted the stranger to
the hut and closed the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what sort of work is on foot,&rdquo; muttered
Merritt to himself. &ldquo;What mischief are those
rascals up to? It&rsquo;s all most mysterious. This
fellow whom we&rsquo;ve seen with Jared first borrows
electric batteries and then tries to send a cipher
message. I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood a moment irresolute as to what course
to pursue. Should he go back and tell Mr.
Raynor what he had discovered? But the next
minute he decided not to. After all he had no
proof; he would try to peep into the hut
and see what was going on. Cautiously he reconnoitered,
completely circling the hut. But
not a gleam of light was visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>Bit by bit he crept closer, using the utmost
caution. At length he got close to the rear wall
and here, to his huge delight, he found a crack
through which he could peer at what was going
on within. What he saw made his heart leap.
Round a table were seated Estrada, Alverado, the
strange man and Jared Applegate. Jared&rsquo;s face
was white and frightened but the others wore
a sort of deadly composure. In the background
stood the old darky who had opened the door.
On the table was a smoky kerosene lamp.</p>
<p>But on the table also were some objects that
puzzled Merritt. There was a brass lever, not
unlike a telegraph key, and by it an array of
batteries with wires leading from them. The
strange man was seated near the brass key, with
which he was toying carelessly, and yet with a
certain caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Alverado was warning him,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be premature, my dear Castro; in your
eagerness you have already broken two batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the accommodating station agent replaced
them. Ha! ha! if he had known what
they were for! But he wouldn&rsquo;t handle cipher,
confound him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was the order of these hated Yankees.
But after to-night we shall triumph over them.
One touch of that key in the right direction
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Estrada, who was speaking, spread his hands
expressively. The others&rsquo; eyes blazed; only
Jared cowered and looked badly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you put it off till I get out of the
country?&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we would have, because of the service you
did us in showing us where to place the&mdash;the little
matter you know of. But you have been well
rewarded. Why repine? As for putting it off,
what time like the present? Mainwaring is away
and those cursed little rats of spies, Boy Scouts,
as you call them, are with him. We are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jared only cowered and quivered the more.
As for Alverado, who had uttered the words just
recorded, he lit a fresh cigarette and regarded the
whining youth with scorn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>Merritt&rsquo;s blood almost froze as he looked on
at this strange scene. He had a quick mind, and
from almost the first he had guessed what that
paraphernalia on the table meant, what the
&ldquo;patriots,&rdquo; as they doubtless called themselves,
were waiting for. But the Boy Scout did not
wait. He ran, as if on wings, from that hut in
the hollow, his pulses beating like snare drums
and a fearful doubt assailing his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he be too late?&rdquo; That was the fear
that pounded at Merritt&rsquo;s brain as he raced along
for the &ldquo;gold-men&rsquo;s&rdquo; row of houses. At the
summit of the little hill, leading up from the
hollow of the hut, he stumbled over something,
something that entangled his foot. He leaned
to examine it and then gave an astonished cry.
The next moment he had whipped out his scout
knife and cut his foot loose of the encumbrance.
After that for some reason he went more slowly,
but still he ran, ran to summon aid for Uncle
Sam against a gang of foul plotters.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Half an hour later the scene in the hut was
not much changed, but a tense silence had fallen
over its inmates. On every face was a strained,
anxious look, yet underlaid by an expression of
exultation. Jared alone was missing. In an
agony of fear and remorse he had broken from
the hut a short time before. They had not tried
to check him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; said Estrada, who held a watch. He
was deadly pale.</p>
<p>The strange young man by the table shoved
back a stray lock of black hair with long, thin
fingers. One hand trembled on that brass key
that Merritt had noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the invader! the usurper! the tyrant take
warning from to-night!&rdquo; cried Alverado solemnly
in a declamatory tone.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a crash outside. The
door was carried inward off its hinges. A crowd
of men, in the uniform of the Gatun police, burst
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize that man!&rdquo; cried Mr. Raynor, who was
in the lead. He pointed to the strange young
man whose fingers were already pressing the
key downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Betrayed!&rdquo; shrieked Alverado as a revolver
was knocked upward out of his hand.</p>
<p>The police, taking no chances after this, sprang
forward toward the man at the key with leveled
weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; they called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve blown Uncle Sam&rsquo;s work to
Kingdom Come!&rdquo; cried the wretch with a hideous
laugh.</p>
<p>His fingers pressed the key. But no earth-shaking
explosion followed. The tons of dynamite
that had been cunningly concealed in a spill-way
half a mile off did not explode. The Gatun
Dam was not hoisted skyward and the work of
years ruined.</p>
<p>There was only a feeble &ldquo;click,&rdquo; echoed by two
more as the handcuffs were snapped on Alverado
and Estrada.</p>
<p>Mr. Raynor fairly embraced Merritt and the
rest crowded round him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, my boy, and your
presence of mind in guessing what that wire was
you stumbled across and cutting it, the dam might
have been blown up in accordance with this
wretch&rsquo;s desires,&rdquo; he declared, and then, as the
miscreant, who had in vain tried to send the
fatal spark to the dynamite, was made a prisoner,
Mr. Raynor raised his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Boy Scouts!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;and in particular for Merritt Crawford of the
Eagles. Had it not been for his quick wits in
guessing that a plot was on foot when he saw
that wretch yonder at the Gatun station, this
might have been a black night for Uncle Sam
and the Panama Canal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheers were given with right good will.
Soon afterward the prisoners, including the old
black man, were marched off to the lock-up maintained
at Gatun for offenders on the canal work,
although, it is safe to say, it never before housed
such monsters as the would-be dynamiters of the
Gatun Dam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only the rest were here and safe,&rdquo; said
Merritt to Mr. Raynor late that night, &ldquo;I should
be perfectly happy. As it is I don&rsquo;t feel as if I
could rest till we are reunited.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was the next day that the entire community,
already wild with excitement over the discovery
of the plot against the dam and the capture of
the chief conspirators, was treated to a fresh
thrill. Down the river, which had somewhat
subsided, came two canoes. In the first one were
Rob and Mr. Mainwaring. In the second sat
Tubby and Fred. How they had met is soon explained.</p>
<p>As Tubby had guessed, the river they had seen
from the ruins was the Chepalta. Its swift current
had carried them into the Chagres itself
and in course of time they came to the spot where
Mr. Mainwaring and Fred, sadly distressed and
worried over the loss of the launch, had decided
to spend the night. They had built a roaring fire
to keep off serpents or wild beasts, and Tubby
and Fred, as soon as they saw the blaze, had
made for it. In a few seconds a joyful reunion
had taken place. As more sleep that night was
out of the question, they had waited till the first
flush of dawn and then emptied one of the provision
canoes. In this Mr. Mainwaring and Rob
seated themselves and they all paddled back to
civilization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>Their amazement when they heard of what had
been taking place at Gatun during their absence
may be, to use a phrase hackneyed but apt,
&ldquo;better imagined than described.&rdquo; There is no
space here to relate all that followed or to give
the details of the trial and sentencing of the
rascally plotters. It was found, for they confessed
in hope of immunity, that the plot was
far more widely organized than had been thought.
Dozens of laborers were implicated before the
end, and it was the number engaged that had
made it possible for them to elude the vigilance
of the Gatun Guards, secrete so much dynamite
and then connect it with wires to the lonely hut
in the hollow. As for the strange young man,
it was found that he had been a chemist specializing
on explosives, who had thought to avenge
his country&rsquo;s fancied wrongs by enlisting with the
plotters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>Had it not been for Merritt, who received the
personal congratulations of Col. Goethals and
the Commission, there is little doubt but that the
great dam might have been damaged almost beyond
hope of reconstruction. The boy bore his
honors modestly, as became a true Scout, and of
course the story did not get to the newspapers, so
that he was spared the embarrassment of being
interviewed and lionized. His comrades felt for
him nothing but pride and admiration.</p>
<p>Those pebbles that Tubby picked up proved to
be raw emeralds of great value and you may be
sure that each of his friends was presented with
one. The chums of Lucy Mainwaring, too, have
noticed that she now wears a brooch set with a
magnificent emerald, by which she seems to set
great store. Who gave it to her we will leave our
readers to guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>Jared Applegate managed in some way to
evade the drag-net set for him, and has not been
seen or heard of since the night he slipped out
of the hut overcome at the last minute by the
thought of the terrible crime he had committed.</p>
<p class="tb">I should like to linger with you in this fascinating
old land with its new interests and tell you
how the ruined city in which Tubby and Fred
passed such an uncomfortable time was explored
and rare treasures of antiquity found. I should
also like to relate more of the adventures that
befell the chums among the &ldquo;Gold-men&rdquo; of the
Isthmus, but I must content myself with what has
been written and my readers with the prophecy
that the future will be able to recall no more noble
achievement than this that has been the subject
of our tale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>You are assured, however, that the Boy Scouts
returned to their studies and to the States better
citizens, better patriots and better Scouts for the
exciting times they spent on Uncle Sam&rsquo;s big
ditch&mdash;the eighth wonder, and the greatest of the
world. Let every American boy, who gets a
chance, see it. It will strengthen and cement his
love for the Stars and Stripes and for the U. S. A.,
the country that put the gigantic enterprise
through in spite of almost overwhelming difficulties.</p>
<p>And now the time has come to say good-bye to
the Boy Scouts. So wishing them well in everything
they undertake and hoping that they may
ever be &ldquo;good scouts and true,&rdquo; the author bids
a reluctant adieu to them and to the readers who
have followed the &ldquo;Eagles&rdquo; through their many
adventures.</p>
